  <title>Migrating to quarto</title>
  <link>https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-04-15-migrating-to-quarto/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I started this blog 10 years ago, first using a jekyll setup. In 2017 I switched to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>, which linked the posts with the Rmarkdown notebook that generated the content. The setup aimed at maximum transparency, with the source living in a <a href="https://github.com/mountainMath/mountaindoodles">public Github repository</a> that keeps all changes transparent, and deploys to the website via <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> directly triggered from the GitHub repo when it changed. That means the website of the blog was always in sync with the repository, and the repository contained the entire history of the blog.</p>
<section id="why-switch" class="level1">
<h1>Why switch?</h1>
<p>This all sounds great, so why change? Pretty much for the <a href="https://www.incidentalfindings.org/posts/2022-08-30_from-blogdown-to-quarto/">same reasons that other have taken this step</a>. But also because <a href="https://quarto.org">quarto</a> as quickly established itself as a superior notebook platform than Rmarkdown. It is designed to be language agnostic, with good support for <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html">R</a>, <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html">Python</a>, <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html">Observable</a> right out of the box. That’s basically my entire toolbox these days. And in all my actual work I have already switched over to using quarto.</p>
<p>At the same time this gives me an opportunity to give the blog a face lift and add some features. It now has the option to switch to dark mode, some better layout and design elements, it automatically generates suggested license information and citation suggestions for each posts (which hopefully cuts down on my emails). It now also automatically generates links to the source code, which I did manually before (and sometimes got the link wrong).</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-switch" class="level1">
<h1>How to switch?</h1>
<p>The process was relatively straight forward thanks to posts by others who have done this before me. I decided that I won’t recreate the original link structure but instead rely on redirects to make sure links to the old blog posts still work. This will however break links to images or other elements of the blog post.</p>
<p>To convert the blog posts I relied on the markdown versions produced by blogdown, that then were fed to the Hugo blog engine. Quarto can also render these markdown documents to html, but they did require some editing to make sure all the links work. I <a href="https://github.com/mountainMath/mountain_doodles/blob/main/R/migration.R">wrote a script to handle the translation</a>, which might be useful to others who are going down the same route even if it caters to some of the idiosyncrasies of my setup.</p>
<p>At the same time I decided to keep the Rmarkdown files for reference, although at this point I set this up as an entirely new repo](https://github.com/mountainMath/mountain_doodles) with all the old code and blog setup in the original <a href="https://github.com/mountainMath/mountaindoodles">mountaindoodles</a> repo. The manual links to the source code still point to the old repo.</p>

<section id="whats-next" class="level1">
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>Other than the look and feel, quarto has the ability to much more easily add interactives by leveraging <a href="https://observablehq.com">Observable</a>. Quarto also has great support for code folding, for this blog we hide code by default but now show a marker that allows it expand the code if desired. This makes it easier to check in on the details of how things are done without having to navigate to the underlying notebook on GitHub. It makes it much easier to quickly grab a code chunk and modify it.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example that pulls in all item and rent CPI time series directly from the StatCan NDM API into the browser and plots them interactively, taken from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mountainmath/year-over-year-change-in-rent-cpi">our interactive ObservableHQ notebook</a>. Live and auto-updating data is great, but this of course also means that the code will fail when StatCan servers are down.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The lower chart is a brush to allow to zoom into time periods of interest in the main chart. The rent CPI method was substantially updated starting in January 2019, the effect of which is quite visible in the graph when zooming in, and the year over year change is fully based on the new method starting January 2020.</p>
<p>One fun part about observable is that the order of the code chunks does not matter. The above code junk produced the chart, but the code to pull in the data from StatCan, and the code to load required libraries is below. This flexibility makes it easier to rearrange a blog post where one does not have to worry about breaking dependencies when moving around the code.</p>

<h1>The downside</h1>
<p>There are a couple of casualties from the switch. One is the comment system. I could have kept the old system, but Disqus has problems. That means that old comments are lost. (There are ways to recover disqus comments, but it means copying and re-posting them under a different account, which is less than ideal.) I decided to switch to <a href="https://giscus.app">giscus</a> as a new commenting system, it integrates nicely with the GitHub repo by using the discussion feature to store comments. No data goes off to other servers. However, this means that a GitHub account is required in order to comment, which will be a barrier to many readers. On the other hand, there really weren’t all that many comments on the old system, so it might not be a big loss.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the links to the posts have changed, but the redirects should (hopefully) solve this.</p>
<p>The RSS feed link might have changed too, not sure, so RSS people might have to subscribe again.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Most of these changes are purely cosmetic, but it gives more flexibility to the authors while automating some tasks. And it makes it easier for readers check into the details of the analysis. We will see how well it holds up. As a safety we are keeping intermediate markdown outputs, which makes it easier to switch back to the old system or to an entirely new system 10 years down the road.</p>
<p>For now we are excited about the new look and feel and the new features and additional flexibility of quarto.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2024/04/11/what-if-recent-apartment-buildings-in-vancouver-were-20-taller/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>Earlier this year a <a href="https://www.productivity.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-02/What-we-gain-by-building-more-homes-in-the-right-places.pdf#page=10">report from the NSW Productivity Commission</a> in New South Wales, Australia, included a useful estimate to illustrate the harm that’s being done by height restrictions in Sydney. We thought it might be helpful to replicate the analysis for the Vancouver context.</p>
<p>Taking ideas from the report we set up a simple counter-factual question:</p>
<p><strong>What would rents be if every apartment building built in Metro Vancouver over the past five years had been on average 20% taller?</strong></p>
<section id="tldr" class="level1">
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>We estimate that planning decisions preventing apartment buildings built in the past 5 years in Metro Vancouver from being on average 20% taller are resulting in an annual redistribution of income from renters to existing landlords on the order of half a billion dollars across the region via higher rents.</p>
</section>
<section id="economics-101" class="level1">
<h1>Economics 101</h1>
<p>To answer our counter-factual question, it’s worth quickly reviewing some basic economics concept. Firstly, the demand curve for housing slopes down. That means that as the price or rent for housing falls, more people will look to buy or rent that housing. That generally leads more households to form, e.g.&nbsp;young adults moving out of their parent’s basement or out of roommate or other complex household situations to form their own households. And it could mean some people that would have otherwise been pushed out are now able to stay, and some people deterred by high housing costs can move into our region. And the reverse of all that will happen if housing prices and rents rise.</p>
<p>How do we know this? Economic theory tells us demand curves generally slope downward and <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/08/17/housing-outcomes/">both theory and data confirm the demographic implications</a>. But to answer our question we need to quantify this more precisely. If we increase our housing stock by some percentage, by what percentage will prices and rents change? This is the (inverse) price elasticity of demand. It is the (inverse of the) slope to the demand curve, shown in black in the plot below, re-expressed in terms of the percentage change of demand and supply.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-04-11-what-if-recent-apartment-buildings-in-vancouver-were-20-taller/index_files/figure-html/supply-demand-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>These type of elasticities are notoriously difficult to identify. We are interested in the “long run” effect, so effects after markets adjust to short-term supply shocks. The report we cite above uses an estimate of -0.4 for Sydney, and estimates <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/media-newsroom/news-releases/2023/update-canada-housing-supply-shortages">done by CMHC for the whole province of British Columbia</a> suggest a similar value of around -0.5. We have <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/bc_SSMUH_TOA_scenarios_Final.pdf">previously estimated the price elasticity of demand for Metro Vancouver to be around -0.25</a>, albeit with large confidence intervals. For this analysis we will use the value of -0.4 which is closer to what the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv13gvj30">broader literature suggests</a>, with the understanding that this estimate comes with uncertainties and actual effects might be a bit larger or a bit smaller. For reference, an estimate of -0.4 is equivalent to calculating that a 1% increase in supply would result in a 2.5% decrease in prices and rents. Since ours is a point estimate of price elasticity, these effects compound, and a 10% increase in supply would result in a 21% decrease in prices and rents.</p>
<p>We note that the supply curve in the graph above is to be taken with a grain of salt. While the demand curve for housing works roughly as one would expect, insofar as housing is largely allocated via market mechanisms, the supply of housing works differently. To list just two caveats, housing is a durable good, with the market largely composed of existing, rather than newly produced, housing. More importantly for our purposes, there are strong external constraints on how much new supply can be added through newly produced housing. Even where supply curves suggest developers would happily add more dwellings in response to prices, planning often prevents them from doing so.</p>

<section id="height-restrictions-in-vancouver" class="level1">
<h1>Height restrictions in Vancouver</h1>
<p>For this post height limitation plays the role of a simple proxy for the restrictiveness of zoning. A <a href="https://eppdscrmssa01.blob.core.windows.net/cmhcprodcontainer/sf/project/archive/research_5/rr_supply_constraints_increased_prices_mar_12.pdf">CMHC report from 2019</a> has found that height restrictions are strongly binding in Vancouver, meaning a developer would be very likely to build taller if they were allowed to do so.</p>
<p>The effect of zoning restrictions is generally difficult to observe when only looking at development proposals that make it into the city approval process, but we can still see some of the effect of height restrictions play out there.</p>
<p>For example the development at 1535-1557 Grant Street was initially <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/courier-archive/real-estate/six-storey-rental-building-proposed-to-replace-four-century-old-grandview-woodland-houses-3082956">proposed as a 6 storey apartment building</a> as in principle enabled under the Grandview-Woodland community plan, but was subsequently <a href="https://council.vancouver.ca/20190723/documents/p10.pdf">cut down to 5 storeys</a> in “direct response” to Urban Design Panel &amp; staff review.</p>
<p>The project at 1805 Larch brought forward under the Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Project went from <a href="https://cityduo.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/a-look-behind-the-curtains-of-city-hall-the-challenges-and-prejudices-renters-face-in-kitsilano/">six to five due to opposition at the pre-application open house</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pwaldkirch/status/1116142005396967424">was compelled to provide more parking spaces</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The development around <a href="https://council.vancouver.ca/20190514/documents/p4.pdf">708 Renfrew Street</a> proposed under the Affordable Housing Choices (AHC) Policy did not see a reduction in the nominal number of storeys, but saw significant massing changes with the original proposal 43% times larger than the version that eventually got approved. However, the reduction in housing units seems to have ultimately <a href="https://twitter.com/rwittstock/status/1324465414949105664">proven fatal</a> to the project’s viability, and the developer abandoned the project.</p>
<p>This motivates our counter-factual of trying to understand what would have happened if recently constructed apartment buildings were on average 20% taller, and had (roughly) 20% more units.</p>
</section>
<section id="apartment-construction" class="level1">
<h1>Apartment construction</h1>
<p>To estimate the impact we look at historical apartment construction in Metro Vancouver, and hypothetically add 20% more units for the past 5 years. This is a rough estimate of what taller buildings could provide, of course. The math linking unit numbers to heights can be more complicated. Taller buildings might’ve enabled more projects (like 708 Renfrew) to “pencil” potentially adding even more units than our estimate. On the other hand, <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/06/12/ins-and-outs-of-cmhc-data/">CMHC also counts secondary suites as “apartment units”</a>, which could lead to us overestimating, but that likely only causes a small distortion in the stats.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-04-11-what-if-recent-apartment-buildings-in-vancouver-were-20-taller/index_files/figure-html/completions-with-counterfactual-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Overall, there were 81,317 apartment completions in the past 5 years. Had the buildings containing these apartments been on average 20% taller there would have been 16,263 additional housing units, resulting in an 1.5% increase in total housing stock in Metro Vancouver. Using our common demand elasticity assumption, that additional housing supply would have led to a reduction of prices and rents by 3.7%.</p>
</section>
<section id="impact-on-rents" class="level1">
<h1>Impact on rents</h1>
<p>To make this a little more concrete, we can use the average rent for 2-bedroom units in Metro Vancouver with a new rental contract in the preceding year as a proxy for the average rent in the region and estimate the counter-factual rents.</p>
<p>CMHC is <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/rental-market/rental-market-report-data-tables">now collecting information of rents of units with new rental contracts</a>, and the average such 2-bedroom unit in Metro Vancouver rented for $2,601 a month in 2023. If apartment buildings built during the past 5 years had been on average 20% taller, then the average rent would have been $93 a month lower, saving the average new renter about $1,120 a year. For comparison, BC’s new <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/income-taxes/personal/credits/renters-tax-credit">Renter’s Tax Credit</a> maxes out at $400 per year.</p>
<p>Rents for long-time tenants tend to be lower than for new tenants under BC’s rent control, reflecting Metro Vancouver’s lengthy history of low vacancy rates driving rents for new contracts ever higher. Correspondingly, for tenants under existing rent-controlled tenancy agreements the benefits of adding supply are less direct than for new tenants. Long-time tenants primarily experience additional supply effects in terms of increased choice and lower rents if they are looking to change their living arrangements because of a lower overall <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2018/11/28/moving-penalty/">moving penalty</a>. But they also potentially gain in their landlords becoming a little less <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/03/29/forced-out-in-canada-new-data-from-chs/">keen to encourage turnover</a>.</p>
<p>At this point it is useful to point out that the aggregate effect of the added counter-factual housing is a net transfer of wealth from existing landlords to tenants. Rent control delays some of these effects, but scaling the rent saving over the existing renter households in Metro Vancouver yields a net transfer of $442M a year from existing landlords to tenants in terms of aggregate rent savings.</p>
</section>
<section id="impact-on-broader-housing-outcomes" class="level1">
<h1>Impact on broader housing outcomes</h1>
<p>On top of that, the increase in housing stock will allow existing households to who are unhappy with their current living arrangements, for <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/08/17/housing-outcomes/">example adults living with parents, or roommates, or other complex living arrangements</a>, to move into their own units. Toronto and Vancouver have elevated rates of such young adults not in <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/08/17/housing-outcomes/">“Minimal Household units”</a>, and new housing units are needed for these young adults to form their own households.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/non_mhu_type-1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This under-appreciated benefit of increasing the housing stock allows individuals and families to better match their housing to their needs and preferences.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>One might be inclined to think that a reduction of average rents from $2,601 to $2,508 a month is quite small. And we agree and believe that our counter-factual increase in new housing by 20% is very modest. We should aim for a much larger increase in housing. Previous <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/06/27/housing-targets/">analysis we performed</a> suggests developers would have built enough units to increase our housing stock by 250,000 units, or 23% if municipalities had let them. This would have resulted in a reduction of average rents by 40%, thus bringing Vancouver rents in line with Canada-wide average CMA rent and resulting in enormous benefits to renters.</p>
<p>Our counter-factuals are purely hypothetical in the sense that we cannot turn back time and allow apartments that have already been built to be taller. But they illustrate the the benefits of building more housing, and the harm of restricting the amount of housing getting built.</p>
<p>We suspect that many municipal planners and politicians don’t understand the extent of the harm to renters or new buyers they are causing by reducing the height of buildings, or more generally by restricting the supply of housing. Planning documents where planners give reasons for significantly reducing height and form of proposed buildings, <a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/2018-527-release3.pdf">like the one for the MIRHPP at Larch and 3rd</a>, are often justified largely on aesthetic grounds (“Substantial massing change is required to provide a compatible form of development […] in relation to the surrounding RT-8 and RM-4 developments”) and do not seem to fully weigh or even consider the tradeoffs of the effects on rents and broader housing outcomes, even in cases like this that contain dedicated below-market units.</p>
<p>The other takeaway from this analysis is that affordability comes from supply effects. In terms of affordability, the purpose of new housing is to make old housing cheaper. Often we hear people ask that new housing be affordable, or that new housing should be targeted at specific income groups. This is entirely appropriate and important when it comes to dedicated non-market housing. But trying to target new market housing at specific income bands fundamentally misunderstands housing, and is likely counter-productive. Or in the <a href="https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/value-capture-reconsidered/">words of Michael Manville</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If we believe that cheap housing matters and expensive housing doesn’t, and we act on that belief, our primary accomplishment will be to make our cheap housing expensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And not coincidentally we have been doing a bang-on job at making our cheap housing expensive across Metro Vancouver.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Three years ago we <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/09/28/first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves/">wrote a post on First Time Buyer Lorenz Curves</a>, looking at what share of homes are in principle available to first-time home buyers.<sup>1</sup> That post continues to be a more popular one, so we thought it would be good to update it with more recent data and expand some of the ideas further.</p>
<p><strong>In this post we want to update this with 2021 data that has now become available, consider the effect of property taxes on affordability that we previously neglected, and introduce a new discretized version of this measure that condenses the information into two parameters, making is easier to digest and compare across different housing markets and allows the tracing of change over time.</strong></p>
<p>Different families have different housing needs, to simplify this we decided to base our affordability measure on adjusted after-tax family income deciles, which is a person-based measure that assigns each person the after tax family income divided by the square root of the number of members in the family unit. This is a standard Statistics Canada concept, based on the idea that when family members share a household and other expenses there are synergies that make the family unit more efficient than the sum of its parts, with efficiency factor roughly given by the square root of the size of the family unit. In short, a couple making a $100k and and person living alone making $71k have similar standards of living <code>\(\left(\frac{100}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{71}{\sqrt{1}}\right)\)</code>.</p>
<p>An added advantage is this gives us a person-based measure, so instead of assessing the affordability of family units, where e.g.&nbsp;a single person gets compared to a family of four, we are comparing people and how they are effected by affordability. This is particulary important due to the composition of family types across metropolitan areas not being the same.</p>
<p>On the housing side, we showed we can similarly divide home prices by the square root of the number of bedrooms to get a stable measure of home prices that is comparable across different home sizes, as measured by number of bedrooms. Like the family example above, a $900k 5 bedroom house is considered to “cost” the same as a $400k 1 bedroom appartment <code>\(\left(\frac{900}{\sqrt{5}} \approx \frac{400}{\sqrt{1}}\right)\)</code>. A potentially better measure for scaling would likely be square footage, but that is not available in the census.</p>
<p>The <em>adjusted GINI curve</em> is then a visual representation of affordability of persons in first-time buyer family units. We believe this measure is useful to give an indication of how accessible ownership is in different housing markets. In particular this <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/08/17/housing-outcomes/">avoides the pitfalls of using household-based measures</a> that are plaguing much of our housing discussions. Family units are the right kind of decision making units when it comes to buying (or renting) housing, so it’s family income that matters.</p>
<section id="first-time-home-buyer-lorenz-curves-in-2021" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-time-home-buyer-lorenz-curves-in-2021">First-time home buyer Lorenz curves in 2021</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look what such a Lorenz curve for potential first-time buyers (essentially renters aged 20 through 49) looks like. To remind us we show the Lorenz curve for Calgary in 2021.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-01-16-first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves-revisited/index_files/figure-html/calgary-ftb-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>In Calgary, potential first-time buyers at the bottom end of the renter income can’t afford any of the homes. Someone at the 20th income percentile of potential first-time buyers can only afford 12% of Calgary homes. But after that things pick up fast and someone at the 60th percentile can afford 75%, at which point things even out and the Lorenz curve hugs the diagonal.</p>
<p>This says nothing about what kind of home someone can afford, or where in the metro area an affordable home may be. It also skirts the discussion about “starter homes” or more generally the question if there is a mismatch between homes first-time buyers are buying and the overall distribution of homes in the metro area in terms of quality or size. Or if there should be such a distinction. What this does is it gives a rough matchup between incomes of (potential) first-time buyers and home values.</p>
<p>With this we can update our Lorenz curves by showing both the 2016 and the new 2021 in the same plot, and adding in 2011 data for good measure, enabling us to see how the affordability distribution has shifted over the last 10 years.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-01-16-first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves-revisited/index_files/figure-html/ftb-updated-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>This reveals that first time buyer affordability has shifted in different ways. The already largely unaffordable markets of Vancouver and Toronto have become further unaffordable. Hamilton shows the worst deterioration of affordability, as measured by the area between the 2016 and 2021 curve. On the other hand, Québec City has become more affordable.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the 2021 census using 2020 income data, and especially low income people benefited from pandemic CERB payments that have lifted them up and explains some of the affordability improvements for the lower income percentiles. We note that this effect is only visible in some metro area, in others increasing home prices have more than offset the temporary pandemic income boost</p>
</section>
<section id="property-taxes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="property-taxes">Property taxes</h2>
<p>This view might be overly optimistic, our affordability metric does not include property taxes and utilities. Cost of utilities are fairly uniform across Canada and don’t change much over time, but property taxes certainly do. And this matters to affordability, for example Québec City’s property tax rates are around 1% of the property value, compared to around 0.3% in Vancouver. Correspondingly people in Vancouver can afford higher-priced homes than people in Québec City on the same income.</p>
<p>Adjusting our affordability metric to include property taxes, for this exercise taken from an <a href="https://www.saskatoon.ca/sites/default/files/documents/asset-financial-management/finance-supply/Altus_Group_Canadian_Property_Tax_Benchmark_Report_2022%20%284%29.pdf">Altus report</a>, shows this effect on affordability quite clearly.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-01-16-first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves-revisited/index_files/figure-html/prop-tax-effect-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>In Vancouver, with it’s relatively low property tax rate, this does not make much of a difference, whereas in other metro areas the difference is substantial.</p>
<p>This should not be taken to mean that property taxes have a causal effect on affordability in the sense that lowering property taxes will increase affordability of first-time buyers. This is because prices are highly endogenous to property taxes, if Québec City’s property tax rates were the same as Vancouver’s the net present value of a home in Québec would be around 31% higher, and exogenously changing property tax rates would cause prices to adjust to reflect that to a large extent. In Canada property tax rates are set by the ratio of aggregate home values to municipal budgets, so prices impact property tax rates. On the other hand, property tax rates impact home prices in the same way that interest rates do, with lower property tax rates leading to higher prices.</p>
<p>With this insight we continue by including property taxes in our affordability metric, with an updated graph for all years and metro areas.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-01-16-first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves-revisited/index_files/figure-html/ftb-pt-1.png" width="768"></p>

<section id="condensing-the-lorenz-curve-into-a-discrete-metric" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="condensing-the-lorenz-curve-into-a-discrete-metric">Condensing the Lorenz curve into a discrete metric</h2>
<p>An obvious candidate for a discrete metric is the GINI coefficient. The GINI coefficient is just the area between the Lorenz curve and the diagonal. This gives a broad measure of affordability in a metro area, a positive coefficient means housing is less affordable, a negative coefficient means housing is more affordable. Perfect proportional affordability is where every potential first time buyer can access housing up to the percentile that corresponds to their percentile in the income distribution.</p>
<p>High unaffordability is characterized by the Lorenz curve staying under the diagonal, high affordability by a curve staying above the diagonal. In many cases we see curves exhibiting high-income skew where they are crossing the diagonal somewhere in the middle of the income spectrum, with lower income people unable to afford homes corresponding to their income percentile while higher income people able to afford homes above their income percentile.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-01-16-first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves-revisited/index_files/figure-html/ftb-synthetic-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>But there are several problems, the first time buyer Lorenz curves can also take values above the diagonal, and for example the two curves show above with zero GINI coefficient are qualitatively quite different. The <em>high-income skew</em> curve models a housing market like Calgary in 2021, where lower income potential first time buyers can’t afford housing corresponding to their income percentile, whereas higher income potential first time buyers can access more than housing that corresponds to their income percentile. The GINI coefficient can’t distinguish between these two cases, both have a GINI of zero, but they represent distinct distributions of (un-)affordability.For analysis and policy making, it is important our metrics summarizing the lorenz curve retains this information.</p>
<p>Intuitively we can think of the two model cases of high (un)affordability and high-income skew as the first two harmonics relative to the diagonal representing perfect proportional affordability. More formally we discretize the Lorenz curves by taking the first two terms of the Fourier expansion of their difference from the diagonal, the <em>perfect proportional affordability</em> lorenz curve . A sine expansion will capture these reasonably well with just a few terms, where the first term is a good approximation of the (scaled) GINI coefficient representing the <strong>aggregate unaffordability</strong> and the second term gives the strength of the main oscillation around the diagonal, interpreted as <strong>high-income skew</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-01-16-first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves-revisited/index_files/figure-html/ftb-approx-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Except for the highly unaffordable metro areas of Vancouver, Toronto and Hamilton the first two (sine) Fourier coefficients capture the curve quite well, for Vancouver, Toronto and Hamilton the approximation struggles to properly capture how long the curve stays flat and how late it rises. This is yet another way how these city’s affordability, or the lack thereof, is extreme compared to the other metro areas.</p>
<p>We can now take these two coefficients and plot their movement over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-01-16-first-time-buyer-lorenz-curves-revisited/index_files/figure-html/ftb-discrete-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>This graph shows that Vancouver, Toronto and Hamilton are in a league of there own when it comes to housing affordability. They exhibit quite similar aggregate unaffordability and high-income skew. Vancouver has been doing quite poorly for the entire decade covered here, whereas Toronto and in particular Hamilton have see their housing affordability radically worsen over the past decade. Ottawa-Gatineau and Montréal are in mildly unaffordable territory, while Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg are fairly neutral in terms of affordability. Québec City is the most affordable market considered here, and its affordability has improved significantly.</p>
<p>We note that the values taken by the CMAs follow a rough frown shape. This is not coincidence, not all values in the range shown can be attained. Values in the lower left and lower right aren’t mathematically possible because the Lorenz curves are monotonic. Values in the top middle correspond to scenarios where lower income families have access to a higher share of housing than their position in the income distribution, whereas higher income households have access to a lower portion of housing. This is not how the housing system works.</p>

<p>We can revisit what this would look like if we did not account for differences in property tax rates.</p>

<p>Omitting property taxes decreases aggregate unaffordability, but it also changes the relative position of the cities. For example, when not accounting for property taxes, Vancouver has slightly higher aggregate unaffordability and slightly stronger high-income skew than Toronto, but this reverses after accounting for property taxes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upshot">Upshot</h2>
<p>This expands on our previous work on Lorenz curves and derived GINI index by adding in 2021 data, and adding the discretization into two metrics, the <strong>aggregate unaffordability</strong> that approximates the GINI index, and the <strong>high-income skew</strong> that captures the degree to which lower income earners do worse than higher income earners. We also included property taxes, as rates differ across metro areas and across time, and this makes a significant difference. Property tax rates were taken from the central municipalities, this could use refinement in future iterations.</p>
<p>This could be expanded on by using higher frequency data like home transactions and the Canadian Income Survey to allow closer monitoring of first time buyer affordability.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2023/08/17/housing-outcomes/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>Almost everyone agrees that we have a housing crisis in Canada, and that it has gotten progressively worse over recent history. But there is a problem. The metrics most commonly used don’t reflect that.</p>
<section id="tldr" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Most commonly used metrics use <strong>existing households as the base of analysis</strong>, but households are a consequence of housing pressures. This kind of <strong>misspecification</strong> is a form of <strong>collider or selection bias</strong> that, especially in tight housing markets, <strong>misleads researchers toward faulty conclusions and policy recommendations</strong>. It blinds researchers to the struggles of people who are unhappy about their current household living arrangement, like young adults struggling to move out of their parent’s place or out of a bad roommate setup, as well as people who have left their desired region and moved away, or failed to move in, because of the lack of housing options.</p>
<p>This post explains the problem with analysis based solely on households in more detail, and explains why this will lead to incorrect diagnoses of our housing problems and misguided policy recommendations.</p>
</section>
<section id="core-housing-need" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-housing-need">Core Housing Need</h2>
<p>The most-cited metric in the context of problems in the housing market in Canada is <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Var.pl?Function=DEC&amp;Id=1230313">Core Housing Need</a>. But looking at the share of households in core housing need for the 2006 through 2021 censuses one would be hard-pressed to conclude that Core Housing Need got worse.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/chn_canada_time-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>2021 was a weird year, of course, and the CERB payments from 2020 likely lifted a lot of people out of Core Housing Need, so we should not focus too much on that drop. But even before the pandemic it seems difficult to argue that Core Housing Need got worse, despite almost everyone agreeing that housing outcomes deteriorated during that time period.</p>
<p>But housing is a local problem, maybe things get washed out when looking at the national level? Turning our lens to local levels doesn’t really change much. Looking at Census Metropolitan Areas we still don’t see a clear trend indicating rising levels of housing need. More often we see the opposite.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/chn_cma_time-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Metro Toronto and Vancouver stand out as higher than other metros, as we might expect, but it doesn’t look like things are getting worse. Maybe the problem is not with the whole metro areas but with the central cities. But again, it’s hard to make out a negative trend. Just looking at Core Housing Need, a naive observer might assume that conditions are pretty stable, with need on the decline in many places. Housing crisis? What housing crisis?</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/chn_city_time-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Does that mean that things actually aren’t getting worse? Are we just imagining the housing crisis? No.&nbsp;We are looking at the wrong metrics.</p>
<p>Core Housing Need has long had issues as a metric, as careful analysts have repeatedly pointed out <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20096621/">over the</a> <a href="https://maytree.com/publications/modernizing-core-housing-need/">years</a>. In short, it attempts to establish a housing standard for all of Canada, <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/core-housing-need">matching existing households to need</a> on the basis of suitably roomy (matched to National Occupancy Standards), adequately maintained (good repair), and affordable (shelter costs no more than 30% of income) housing, or affordable alternatives that might meet their needs nearby. To list a few criticisms of the measure:</p>
<style>
ol.alpha {
  counter-reset: list;
}
ol.alpha > li {
  list-style: none;
}
ol.alpha > li:before {
  content: counter(list, lower-alpha) ") ";
  counter-increment: list;
}
</style>
<ol class="alpha">
<li>
affordable alternatives aren’t actually assessed for availability
</li>
<li>
location of housing impacts transportation costs
</li>
<li>
a 30% shelter cost to income cutoff lacks solid justification
</li>
<li>
the metric excludes many households (e.g.&nbsp;students, income lower than shelter cost)
</li>
<li>
shelter costs are inconsistently assessed
</li>
<li>
incomes are temporally mismatched (from previous year) relative to shelter costs (current)
</li>
<li>
adequacy of maintenance (based on self-reported repair) misses important elements
</li>
<li>
suitable roominess (based on Canadian National Occupancy Standards) lacks solid justification
</li>
<li>
existing households might not be preferable arrangements
</li>
<li>
existing households miss in- and out- migration/mobility responses
</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, there is a lot more to housing outcomes than what is currently captured in Core Housing Need.</p>
</section>
<section id="housing-outcomes" class="level1">
<h1>Housing outcomes</h1>
<p>If our current Core Housing Need is inadequate for capturing housing outcomes, then how can it be fixed? Some of the points we listed above have been addressed by others and by ourselves in previous posts. Points a) through h), in particular, could plausibly be addressed by refining the input metrics for Core Housing Need. Points i) and j) are fundamentally different in that they question the base unit of all measurements that go into Core Housing Need: Existing Households.</p>
<p>To understand this better, we start by looking at how people experience housing pressures. From the perspective of individuals navigating a constrained housing market we want to highlight five distinct housing outcomes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>(<strong>unaffordability</strong>) People pay more money to access the housing they need than they can afford, living beyond their means or sacrificing other important expenses.</li>
<li>(<strong>unsuitability</strong>) People squish into housing without enough room for their household, sacrificing privacy within the household.</li>
<li>(<strong>inadequacy</strong>) People live in housing that’s inadequately maintained or in bad repair.</li>
<li>(<strong>suppressed households</strong>) People fail to achieve their desired household composition, living with more or different people than they would like to.</li>
<li>(<strong>housing-induced migration</strong>) People move to a different region, either farther away from their jobs, friends, and places of leisure within the same metro area or to an entirely different part of the country.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only the first three channels are captured in some way by the Core Housing Need metric (or the related <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/blog/2020-housing-observer/new-affordability-metric-assesses-household-ability-afford-basic-goods">Housing Hardship</a> metric) as based on existing households.</p>
<section id="existing-households-are-the-wrong-unit-of-measurement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="existing-households-are-the-wrong-unit-of-measurement">Existing households are the wrong unit of measurement</h2>
<p>In most of Canadian data and theorizing, a <em>household</em> <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/definition-eng.cfm?ID=households-menage007">is defined as an <em>occupied dwelling unit</em></a>, although <em>household</em> is often also used as a shorthand for only <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/definition-eng.cfm?ID=households-menage014"><em>private households</em></a>. Households are the outcome of how people distribute over dwellings.</p>
<p><strong>Basing analysis entirely on existing households is selecting on a consequence of the outcome, it introduces selection or collider bias</strong>. This bias is substantial, <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/10/03/still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/">the degree to which housing pressures impact household formation are large and growing</a>, and an <strong>existing household-based analysis is blind to suppressed household formation, as well as to the effects of housing on migration</strong>.</p>
<p>To better understand collider bias in this context consider <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/00491241221099552">Model 18 in this excellent monograph on good and bad controls</a>. Alternatively one can interpret selecting on households that have formed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a> that ignores households that would have formed if housing pressures were different. This also highlights why it is necessary to choose counter-factual scenarios of different housing pressures. For market housing these counter-factual scenarios should be chosen to be realistically achievable, by for example <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/06/estimating-suppressed-household-formation/">comparing with regions with different housing policies but similiar economic and demographic environments</a>, or by <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/06/27/housing-targets/">estimating how much housing the market would produce if municipal regulations preventing housing were removed</a>. Non-market housing counter-factual scenarios should similarly work toward being achievable in order to be taken seriously, and, when interpreted from a rights based approach, set in relation to housing outcomes achievable in market housing.</p>
<p>On a personal level, housing pressures are experienced through unaffordability when people or families can’t afford housing that fits their needs, be it proximity to jobs and amenities, or size and number of bedrooms. <strong>But their inability to afford said housing generally won’t show up in Core Housing Need because in most cases they don’t actually move into the housing they can’t afford.</strong> The same principle generally applies to waitlisting for non-market housing.</p>
<p>That’s all quite abstract, let’s unpack this a little.</p>
<p>Take a roommate household made up of four roommates, where two people have coupled up. The couple would like to move out into their own place, but they can’t find a place within their budget that’s reasonably close to their jobs. So they stay in their roommate situation. They may be delaying their plans to have kids until they find a better housing situation that they feel secure about, and maybe has an extra bedroom to accommodate their future child. They are not in core housing need because the combined household income of all four roommates easily covers rent and utilities, but they do feel like their housing needs aren’t being met and it’s forcing them to adjust life plans. This kind of household would be classified as a <em>one-census family household with additional persons</em>, and across Canada there are around 666,000 of these, 493,000 of which have children present.</p>
<p>To take a different example, the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/divorce-housing-challenges-canada-1.6926859">CBC recently ran a piece</a> on how former couples wishing to separate or divorce increasingly find themselves forced to either continue living together or move in with friends and relatives. This clearly relates to the rising difficulty of finding housing. But the Core Housing Need measure sees no problem with these situations, at least as long as there’s a spare bedroom satisfying the National Occupancy Standard criteria for uncoupled adults. The issues are further compounded when children are involved in split households, insofar as the need for roominess grows, and in joint custody cases, may even double. But unsurprisingly, the Core Housing Need metric also ignores custody questions (kids are only supposed to show up once as part of a Census household).</p>
<p>We take this opportunity to update our overview graph <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/12/01/what-s-a-household/">from a previous post</a> on households by household type and census family structure using 2021 data.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/hh_type_2021-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This highlights some of the complexities of households, and how they don’t necessarily map onto family units. In particular we notice how Montréal has comparatively few complex households.</p>
</section>
<section id="minimum-household-units" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minimum-household-units">Minimum Household Units</h2>
<p>If households aren’t the right unit of analysis, then what is? We have <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2021/11/28/first-peek-at-population-and-household-data-during-covid-caveats/">discussed and compared different conceptualizations of what constitutes a basic unit in the past</a>, including the OECD definition of a household that StatCan uses within their National Accounts framework, as well as one looking at census (or economic) families and unattached individuals that we already highlighted in our <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/12/01/what-s-a-household/">post on households</a>. But even non-divorcing census families might feel the need to split up, for example if they contain adult children living with parents who might want to move out but can’t find suitable housing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0032472031000141266">Ermisch and Overton introduced the concept of Minimal Household Units (MHU)</a> to better understand household formation. The idea is to define elemental building blocks of households, which may combined to form “complex” households. They start with single adults, parent-child, and couple relationships where we typically assume people want to live together, leaving four basic building blocks for households as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Adult individuals</li>
<li>Lone parents with dependent children</li>
<li>Childless married (or common law) couples</li>
<li>Married (or common law) couples with dependent children</li>
</ol>
<p>This leaves out some complexities (e.g <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11771-eng.pdf">Living Apart Together setups</a> where couples want to remain couples, but live separately), but is simple and works well for the purpose of analyzing household formation and affordability in the context of housing. The assumption is basically that household complexity beyond MHU is likely influenced (though not completely determined) by housing scarcity, revealing a portion of people living together who might prefer to live apart.</p>
<p>Looking up at our graphs on household composition by age we note that the blue households approximate minimum household units, with the exception that some of them have adult children living at home. To better understand this we focus on 25 to 34 year olds and examine what share of them live in MHUs vs complex households, and how this has changed through time and across geographies.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/mhu_type-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We notice overall declining trends in the total proportion of 25 to 34 year olds in MHUs, and substantially lower shares in Toronto and Vancouver compared to the other large CMAs. Vancouver has higher shares of childless couples than Toronto, but lower shares of couples with children. By contrast, Montréal has the highest proportion of 25 to 34 year olds living within MHUs, driven largely by more people living alone and part of couples with children (though the latter is still on the decline). In the 35 to 44 year old age groups we still notice slightly declining trends in some CMAs, and again lower levels in Toronto and Vancouver. Once more, Montréal has the highest proportion of 35 to 44 year olds living in MHU.</p>
<p>If young adults aren’t living in MHUs, how do they live? Here are the living arrangements of the remaining young adults.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/non_mhu_type-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>There’s no single category dominating trends or differences. The proportion of young adults living as roommates went down in Calgary, but up in Vancouver and Toronto. The proportion living in complicated family arrangements also generally rose. Compared to other metros, Toronto and Vancouver have higher shares in all categories, except people living in census families with additional persons and roommate households. The high share of people living with their parents stands out in these two metros, but also a higher share of multi-generational households. Of note, the share in multi-generational households has been declining for 25 to 34 year olds over this time period for Vancouver and Toronto, and it declined 2016-2021 for the 35 to 44 year old group, while most other categories increased. In particular, the increases in young adults in non-MHUs in Toronto and Vancouver cannot be attributed to multi-generational living arrangements.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we don’t have this data at finer age groups; that would require a custom tabulation. But at the expense of not being able to distinguish couple MHUs with or without children, we can use a different table to take a quick look at how overall MHU shares progress through age cohorts over time and across geographies. Housing stress can lead to couples feeling <a href="https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/csp/index.php/csp/article/view/16051">without enough room</a> or <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02673031003711485">otherwise unprepared for children</a>, so it’s unfortunate we lose an indicator of children for couples. On the bright side, the data allow us to make different interesting distinctions between married and common-law couples and add in the 20 to 24 year old age group.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/children_family_mhu-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Stepping up through age groups we see progressively higher shares of young adults living in MHU, as one would expect. However, within each age group the shares of young adults in MHUs has decreased over time, and there is large variation across metro areas. These trends aren’t all due to housing pressures, they get confounded by young adults spending more time in school and possibly by shifts in preferences, including by culture, but it seems far-fetched to attribute most of the variation across time and metro areas to this. Indeed, one of the most notable cultural differences appears in the distinction between common-law partnerships, which are far more common within Montréal (and across Quebec), and marriage, which has been more common elsewhere. The difference between common-law and marriage doesn’t matter for purposes of assigning people into MHU, but the relative decline of marriage is in keeping with Canada’s entry into the Second Demographic Transition, and given the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02673030600917826">connections between marriage with home ownership</a>, it’s striking that married couples are the category most strongly driving the decline in MHU for young adults everywhere.</p>
<p>Overall across Canada 52% of adults aged 20 to 34 lived in MHUs in 2021, down from 54% in 2016 and 56% in 2011. In contrast with Core Housing Need, here’s a clearer indicator of conditions getting worse over Canada’s recent history. How did those outside of MHUs live? What was the makeup of their complex households?</p>

<p>We see a striking rise in young adults outside of MHUs, especially those living with their parents or other family members. Toronto and Vancouver also stand out in this regard. There are several factors playing into temporal and regional patterns, but housing pressures are likely the most important driver. Yet metrics based on existing households, like Core Housing Need, will systematically overlook this kind of evidence of housing pressure.</p>
</section>
<section id="household-maintainer-rates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="household-maintainer-rates">Household maintainer rates</h2>
<p>Another way to think about this kind of housing pressure is to look at age-specific household maintainer rates, and how these differ across geographies and time. We have <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/10/03/still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/">looked at this previously</a> and documented how Montréal, Toronto, and Vancouver used to have fairly similar household maintainer rates in the 70s. But while Montréal’s rates have remained relatively stable, Vancouver and Toronto have seen significant drops in household maintainer rates, especially among younger adults, as illustrated in the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/hmr_age_group-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This remains a static picture, providing cross-sections of the overall state of the population in the given years. We can make this more dynamic by following fixed birth cohorts over time to see how their household maintainer rates change as they age. Comparing across birth cohorts gives us a better sense of generational change in household maintainer rates. Of note, we don’t have full data over the 50 years covered in this graph, so some of the trajectories are only partial.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/hmr_birth_cohort-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>In Montréal successive birth cohorts trace out similar trajectories, eclipsing the 1931 through 1945 cohorts but then not changing much starting with the 1946-1950 birth cohort. But in Toronto and Vancouver younger cohorts are experiencing significantly lower household formation rates compared to previous generations that persist as people age into their 40s.</p>
<p>Another way to slice the data is to look at how many years households in Toronto and Vancouver lag relative to Montréal’s 1956-1960 birth cohort, selecting an age cohort fully covered in our window of observation.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/hmr_cohort_year_lag-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Here we see how Toronto and Vancouver are lagging behind their Montréal peers when it comes to forming and maintaining a household, with millennial and GenX households lagging by over 10 years by the time they reach 40. In other words, Millennials and GenX household formation rates by the time they reach 40 in Vancouver and Toronto are about equivalent to what their peers in Montréal reached in their late 20s.</p>
<p>We have interpreted this as <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/10/03/still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/">suppressed household formation</a> and a partial measure of housing shortfall. While we believe that this interpretation is generally correct, a potential alternative interpretation is that this trend <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/06/estimating-suppressed-household-formation/">may be explained by different cultural preferences, which we’ve also attempted to quantify</a>, and further work on this would be useful. Nonetheless, we believe that estimates of suppressed households offer a useful metric to assess housing shortages.</p>
</section>
<section id="household-tightness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="household-tightness">Household tightness</h2>
<p>Specifying the role that housing plays in our suppressed household measure is hard to pin down. But we can look at related metrics of housing outcomes to see if there’s more evidence of squeeze. Maybe it’s not there. People could be sharing more often because there’s lots of room to do so. Imagine we have a large reservoir of big houses, and people choose to form more complex households as the average household size of MHUs has been declining over time due to dropping fertility rates, people coupling up later, and people living longer.</p>
<p>Ideally we would want to look at data on how people distribute over floor space, but we simply don’t have reliable floor space data in Canada. The <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=4610005301">Canadian Housing Statistics Program</a> has some information on living area, but only for select types of housing and only for recent years and not (yet) covering all of Canada. The <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/statistical-programs/instrument/3881_Q2_V8">Survey of Household Energy Use</a> has some data on “heated living area” going back to the 1990s, with some aggregate estimates <a href="https://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/menus/sheu/2019/tables.cfm">made available by NRCAN</a>, but it is not clear how these estimates are derived and how reliable they are.</p>
<p>Another way to understand how cramped or roomy living situations are is to look at the number of rooms available by household size. The census keeps track of the <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=dwelling-logements012">number of rooms in a dwelling unit</a> as well as household size, giving us long timelines to work with. This still poses some challenges insofar as people’s preferences for how to slice up homes have changed too, with for example people sometimes tearing down interior walls, e.g.&nbsp;between dining room and living room, when remodelling. This results in fewer rooms, but the home is still as “roomy” as before. Some of that can be controlled for by comparing across different regions in Canada.</p>
<p>Yet another complication is that real incomes have grown over time, and housing demand increases strongly with income, with <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv13gvj30">most estimates pegging the demand elasticity of income to be greater than 1</a>. This means that we should expect to see an increase in <em>roominess</em> over time as incomes grow.</p>
<p>Understanding these complications, let’s take a look at the distribution of number of rooms by household size, and how this varies across census years and metro areas.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/rooms_timeline-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>A lot of data is captured here, and overall this suggests that 2006 was peak “roominess” across Canada, having generally near the maximum number of rooms for a given household size and metro area. Roominess was growing in the period before 2006, and it has been declining since. The decline in roominess is unexpected, given rising real incomes over this time period. This could reflect trends in hardship not well captured by Core Housing Need, but possibly also an increasingly urban population, making trades of room for centrality. At the same time, even this measure may understate the extent of rising hardship. After all, we’re still only counting children in joint custody situations once, and there has been no decline in single parent households or joint custody arrangements accompanying the decline in household roominess. Moreover, the share of homes in Canada not occupied by usual residents was stable (actually declining slightly) over the 2006-2021 time period, indicating that secondary residences or vacation homes are unlikely to have offset this decline in roominess.</p>
<p>The peak in 2006 is also interesting for many reasons, not least of which because of what happened between 2006 and 2011. 2008-2009’s Great Recession and Financial Crisis saw a dramatic drop in the construction of housing. This carried over from the USA into Canada even though our housing prices didn’t drop as much and <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/mortgage-and-debt/canadian-us-mortgage-arrears-foreclosure-rates-archived">we had nowhere near similar foreclosure rates</a>. If, as <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/housing-was-undersupplied-during-great-housing-bubble">Kevin Erdmann makes the case</a>, rising construction rates up to the 2008-2009 crisis were actually justified in the USA, then the case is potentially even stronger for Canada. And we can see the effects of the pullback in building since 2006 on the decreasing roominess of housing relative to household size.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/completions-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Raw starts and completions should be interpreted with caution, and do not account for demolitions or changes in CMHC estimation methods. But we can clearly see here the dramatic drop-off in starts after the Financial Crisis, followed by a decline in completions. We can only wonder where Canada would be now in terms of housing had the Crisis not spread North from the USA.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to historical variation, we’ve also got variation in roominess by region. We can take a closer look at how this compares across metro areas in 2021, and add in variations by tenure.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/rooms_tenure-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Here we see that renter households tend to have significantly less room than owner households, aligning with <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/04/20/a-bedroom-is-a-bedroom/">our previous observation that renter households tend to be larger given a fixed number of bedrooms</a>. Owner households tend to be richer, and richer people consume more housing.</p>
<p>However, this basic fact does not hold when comparing across metro areas. On average people in Vancouver and Toronto have higher incomes and higher wealth than their counterparts in Montreal, but lower levels of roominess. It’s tricky to argue that people in Vancouver and Toronto simply prefer to have fewer rooms than people in other urbanized parts of Canada. This is very likely yet another sign of a housing shortage and people economizing in response to rising prices.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Core Housing Need metric does incorporate a measure of roominess (suitability, as determined by whether a given household can be understood as fitting into bedrooms according to National Occupancy Standards), but the crudeness of the metric, in conjunction with the alternative affordable housing rule and the taking of existing households as given, all means it doesn’t pick up the decline in household roominess since 2006 or variations in roominess by metro area.</p>
</section>
<section id="migration-impacts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="migration-impacts">Migration impacts</h2>
<p>We’ve seen how relying upon existing households for metrics of housing need creates problems insofar as existing residents of a place may wish to distribute themselves differently. But what about non-residents? What about those forced out or never able to arrive?</p>
<p><em>Leaving Vancouver</em> letters seem to have moved from novelty to <a href="https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2017/10/30/I-Left-Vancouver/">well worn cliche</a> and now to the point where people just move away without the fanfare. Housing always featured prominently in the <em>Leaving Vancouver</em> letters, but motivations are complex and the effects of housing on migration are difficult to identify. For this post we will have to be satisfied with some weak evidence showing that shifts in migration over time are consistent with the idea that housing pressures impact migration paths, but we don’t present enough evidence to claim that housing pressures are the cause of that shift.</p>
<p>We conceptualize housing pressures to impact migration most at the local and regional level, and less so at inter-provincial and international levels. This is consistent with <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2019/11/24/why-do-people-move-new-data-mysteries-and-fundamental-rights/">“reason for move” data</a>, where housing reasons for move dominate more local levels, but recede as a deciding factor as move distance increases. So here we focus on intra-provincial migration. Are we seeing less net in-migration to Metro Vancouver from other parts of the province than we used to see in the past?</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/yvr_intraprovincial-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This shows a declining trend in intra-provincial in-migration, and net-migration, and an increasing trend in out-migration between 1999 and 2021, the last year for which we have gross migration data. To better understand these shifts we can look at the difference in age-specific intra-provincial net migration rates at the beginning and the end of our time frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/yvr_net_intraprovincial_age-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Intra-provincial migration rates have dropped for almost all age groups, but not by the same amount. The drop in net migration rates is most pronounced for young children, neutral for ages starting university (<a href="https://pair.cms.ok.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2023/03/UBC-Annual-Enrolment-Report-2022-23.pdf">hello UBC</a>!), and quickly dropping off again for young adults thereafter. Around age 40, the drop-off from 2001/2002 rates reduces, before again dropping below the baseline trend. We might imagine this as reflecting the decline in housing accessibility for young adults, matching a corresponding decline in perceptions of achievable opportunity in Metro Vancouver. By 40, selection effects may have kicked in, with only those who have achieved decent housing outcomes or adjusted to alternatives remaining. This suggests how causal forces within the relationship may flip after age 40, with older home owners increasingly moving out over recent history as a way of cashing in on selling their homes. After the age of 55 the net migration rates once again converge toward the 2001/2002 levels.</p>
<p>The narrative we offer tying intra-provincial migration patterns to housing affordability seems plausible, but requires more research. Moreover, it’s worth keeping in mind that 2021/2022 was still a year where people were responding to the upheavals of the pandemic. Given possible pandemic impacts on migration patterns, we repeat this with 2018/2019 as the final year, which shows very similar patterns, showing that especially young adults are increasingly leaving the region on net, with the exception of people around the age they start university and people around 40 years old.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-08-17-housing-outcomes/index_files/figure-html/yvr_net_intraprovincial_age_pre_covid-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>These patterns are consistent with the notion that people are leaving the region due to housing pressures, where they leave the region in the ages where family formation happens or they can’t find adequate housing for their growing family. But the link remains weakly established, and it’s not yet tested enough to make clear causal claims. We believe this is a useful area for future research.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-upshot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-upshot">The upshot</h2>
<p>Existing households within a region are an outcome of housing pressures, and selecting on existing households as the unit for analysis introduces collider bias. We believe this bias is substantial.</p>
<p>Much of Canadian housing discussions focuses on affordability as experienced by existing households. This is understandable because affordability is the main channel through which individuals experience housing pressures. But focusing on existing households as the base metric here can be very misleading. In particular, tracing shelter-cost-to-income ratios over time for the households that manage to form within a region shows little to no worsening in housing affordability. At best, it blinds researchers to a large part of how housing pressures manifest themselves. At worst, it leads to grotesque misdiagnoses arguing that Canada has a sufficient supply of housing (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://mailchi.mp/chec-ccrl/build-baby-build-wont-solve-the-housing-crisis?e=4d3dff1ab8">“because Canada puts more people in each home, it requires fewer homes per capita”</a>).</p>
<p>Housing is a central part of everyone’s lives, and Canada’s housing struggles are having increasingly severe impacts on the lives of Canadians. Housing analysis, especially when meant to inform policy, needs to do better at understanding the metrics it uses, how to use them, and the limits of their usefulness.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2023/06/27/housing-targets/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>Municipalities in BC are required to submit <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/policy-and-planning-tools-for-housing/housing-needs-reports">Housing Needs reports</a>, and integrate these into Official Community Plans and Regional Growth Strategies in something resembling housing targets. The <a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/bills/billsprevious/3rd42nd:gov43-1">BC Housing Supply Act</a> now sharpens this process and adds some <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/11/24/new-premier-new-housing-policy/">teeth</a>, effectively enabling the province to define housing targets, accompanied by new provincial enforcement mechanisms, where the province <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0059-000851">selects municipalities</a> not meeting housing need. Left unstated are the details of precisely how we should go about calculating housing needs or housing targets.</p>
<p>It’s most useful to think of this question in two parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>how much overall housing is needed, and</li>
<li>how much non-market housing (or cash supplements) is needed to ensure everyone has access to housing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Setting housing targets for municipalities in BC is chiefly about the first. Non-market housing and housing supplements are generally the responsibility of higher levels of government. But overall targets and non-market housing are connected as part of a broader housing system, and ideally work together. Building more housing of all sorts <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119023000414">reduces pressures and need for specifically non-market housing</a>, and building non-market housing counts toward overall housing needed as well as having a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022001048?via%3Dihub">stronger impact on affordability at the lower end of the market than building market housing alone</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we focus on setting overall housing targets for municipalities, but we’ll revisit non-market need.</p>

<h1>Why do we need overall housing targets?</h1>
<p>Municipalities have generally adopted very restrictive policies when it comes to new housing that to a large degree <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/02/06/a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/">remove key market mechanisms from the process of housing provision</a>. Supply is not enabled to rise in response to rising demand, but rather must first go through a complicated, uncertain, expensive, and lengthy municipal approvals process. What’s more, evidence suggests the process tends to grow increasingly complicated, uncertain, expensive, and lengthy over time. Strong targets work against this tendency, providing a mechanism that tells municipalities how much housing they “need” to approve and see built within specific time windows. Ideally strong targets push municipalities toward simpler, more certain, cheaper, and faster approval processes.</p>
<p>We take it for granted that overall housing targets should be put in place to solve the problems created by municipalities restricting housing. This sets up a relatively simple conceptual approach for how to establish targets. Where would we be if municipalities weren’t restricting housing?</p>
<p>We can break this counterfactual question down into three interrelated parts: How much extra housing could have been built in the past had we not held it back? How many more people would have arrived or stayed if we had built that extra housing? How much cheaper would housing be if we had built that extra housing?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t easily answer these questions about a past that never was. But we can lay out a procedure for building up answers to related questions in the present, and look at possibilities for extending them into the future. And that’s how we should be constructing housing targets.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-should-we-construct-targets" class="level1">
<h1>How should we construct targets?</h1>
<p>How much extra housing could be built now if municipalities weren’t holding it back? This is our most relevant measure of housing shortfall. To provide a rough answer, we can look at how the costs of constructing housing currently relate to the price new housing can fetch on the market. The difference between the two (price - costs) constitutes a “wedge” providing an indicator of how much extra housing could profitably be built. As more housing gets built, it should drive up supply and drive down price. As prices decline toward costs, the wedge approaches zero. At the point where the wedge equals zero, we can be pretty sure municipal approval processes aren’t holding back new housing, because developers wouldn’t find it profitable to build anyway (elsewhere in the literature, the point where the wedge equals zero is also known as the <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14193/w14193.pdf">Minimum Profitable Production Cost</a>).</p>
<p>But how fast new supply drives down price depends upon how much demand it meets. We need estimates of demand elasticity. Measurements of demand elasticity provide a way to estimate at least partial answers to our second and third questions. How many more people would stay or come to Vancouver if we had a bunch of extra housing? And how much cheaper would housing be if we had a bunch of extra housing? These questions are interrelated: we can’t really answer one without the other.</p>
<p>Of note, all of our answers for questions about the present will also relate to our historical counterfactual questions, but the questions aren’t quite the same. After all, building standards have tightened and it’s now more expensive to build housing. We can consider the rise in building standards as accompanying, and perhaps even part of the rise complicated, uncertain, expensive, and lengthy municipal approval processes. But to the extent newer standards result in better quality, more accessible, and more sustainable housing, we don’t want to get rid of them. Also, building out more gradually over time would have allowed buildings to depreciate, resulting in a more balanced price distribution throughout the housing spectrum. This can’t be fixed retroactively, the best time to build housing was yesterday, but the second best time is now.</p>
<section id="estimating-current-housing-shortfall" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimating-current-housing-shortfall">Estimating current housing shortfall</h2>
<p>To estimate current housing shortfall we focus on the type of housing that we can expect to be most effective in adding housing: multifamily apartment buildings. These also happen to be the type of housing most restricted by municipalities. While we could (and should) add single family homes by subdividing existing single family lots or stratifying them into row/townhouses, the main contribution of growth in housing will have to come from apartments. And while we are generally more concerned about rental than ownership housing, our data on rental is simply not good enough to use for this kind of analysis. Here we focus on prices, with the understanding that people trade off owning vs renting and ownership, and rental affordability moves in tandem in the medium to long term.</p>
<p>We estimate housing shortfall in three steps that together address our questions above, providing a relatively simple conceptual approach.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Estimate the <em>wedge</em> between the price new housing fetches and what it costs to build, including land but assuming no or little restrictions on density or location.</li>
<li>Estimate the demand elasticity to price, that is the shape of the demand curve.</li>
<li>Estimate the housing shortfall, that is the amount of housing needed until the <em>wedge</em> is competed away.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the rubber hits the road it will get a little more complicated, but let’s take a look how this could be done for some Metro Vancouver municipalities.</p>
<section id="estimating-the-wedge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimating-the-wedge">Estimating the wedge</h3>
<p>CMHC analysts have <a href="https://eppdscrmssa01.blob.core.windows.net/cmhcprodcontainer/sf/project/archive/research_5/rr_supply_constraints_increased_prices_mar_12.pdf">estimated the wedge</a> for overall CMAs and municipalities within them based on 2018 prices. In their analysis the cost includes developer profit, but no land component. Glaeser suggests that around 20% of the sale price should be land cost in an unregulated market, so we apply this ratio to the wedge estimates from the report to obtain the “excess price” of housing. The idea here is that the optimum density is such that when everything is said and done the purchase price of the land makes up 20% of the sale price of the new housing built on top.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-27-housing-targets/index_files/figure-html/excess-price-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>North Vancouver here combines the District and the City. Of note, this suggests that Surrey builds housing roughly in line with demand. But the more centrally located municipalities of Vancouver, North Vancouver, Richmond and Burnaby, are under-building with respect to demand. This speaks to not just the overall housing shortage, but also the spatial misallocation of housing in the region, <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/06/20/metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/">both of which are to a large extent promoted by Metro Vancouver regional planning</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="demand-elasticity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demand-elasticity">Demand elasticity</h3>
<p>To translates our wedge estimates into current housing shortfall estimates we need to assess the demand elasticity of price. For BC overall CMHC has estimated a demand elasticity of -0.5, so all else being equal for every 1% of increase in housing supply prices fall by 2%, the inverse demand elasticity. Ideally one would try to get more detailed estimates for Vancouver, but the reality is that the shape of the demand curve is difficult to estimate and comes with large uncertainties, suggesting we should probably report ranges rather than point estimates. We add estimates using demand elasticities between -0.7 to -0.3 that roughly cover the range seen in the literature. Combining this with housing stock estimates this gives us estimates of the current (2018) housing shortfall, which should be interpreted as the number of dwelling units needed to compete away the excess cost.</p>
<p>There are some potential issues with these estimates, for example housing demand is not homogeneous, and given how far prices are from equilibrium of Minimum Profitable Production Cost our extrapolation may be off. Moreover, current construction tends to cater to the higher end of the market, we expect that to change as we slide down the demand curve, in which case we will see less fancy, and thus cheaper, construction, which increases the wedge and deepens the range of price effects we would see. We believe that using a broad range of demand elasticities should cover this and other uncertainties in this process. This gets us to the current housing shortfall, which to no surprise is concentrated in the central parts of the region, in particular the City of Vancouver.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-27-housing-targets/index_files/figure-html/housing-shortfall-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We note that our simple estimate of a shortfall of 250k housing units for Metro Vancouver stacks up pretty well against other relevant estimates. For instance, the <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/10/03/still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/">suppressed household estimate we calculated suggests a shortage of between 130k to 200k dwellings for Metro Vancouver</a> looking at household maintainer rates for existing residents alone, but not including those outside the region. To put it differently, we would anticipate many more people moving into their own households instead of doubling up with others if more housing were available, but we would also expect more people remaining in or arriving to Vancouver.</p>
<p>Regardless, these estimates are pegged to the present, and housing can’t be created instantly. To transform our estimates into housing targets we need to set a goal for some point in the future. But housing demand will likely grow in that time frame, necessitating more housing. This leads us to thinking not just about our current shortfall, but also about future shortfalls. How do we plan ahead?</p>
<p>One option is to benchmark against business as usual development, adding more on top. We see this with the <a href="https://assets.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/sites/cmhc/professional/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/research-reports/2022/housing-shortages-canada-solving-affordability-crisis-en.pdf?rev=88308aef-f14a-4dbb-b692-6ebbddcd79a0">CMHC housing target for BC of an additional 570k units over the next 10 years</a> needed to bring affordability back in line with 2003-2004 levels. On first pass, our estimated shortfall of 250k households in Metro Vancouver fits pretty well with this target, insofar as Metro Vancouver contains over half the population of BC. But the fit isn’t perfect, and given that this is a different measure, speaking to a distinct affordability standard already considered unacceptable across the rest of Canada, and calculated out 10 years into the future, we shouldn’t expect it to be. How might we come up with our own housing target?</p>
</section>

<section id="estimating-future-housing-demand" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimating-future-housing-demand">Estimating future housing demand</h2>
<p>This is where we have to make some assumptions. How will the demand for housing grow in the future, say over the next 10 years? For the purposes if this post we take a very rough shortcut and piggy-back off of <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/regional-planning/PlanningPublications/Metro_Vancouver_Growth_Projections_Tables.pdf">Metro Vancouver projected household growth</a>. As we <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/06/20/metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/">discussed in our last post</a>, Metro Vancouver’s methods underlying projected household growth systematically underestimate demand, and we remedy this by assuming that they underestimate demand in line with the size of our current housing shortfall above. After all, the same growth management strategies baked into the Metro Vancouver projections is exactly what leads to our current housing shortfall.</p>
<p>So to get to projections of future housing demand we scale Metro household projections up by the ratio of the current shortfall to the existing dwelling stock. This may over-estimate demand a bit since traditionally Metro Vancouver fell short of meeting their household targets, but it may also underestimate demand insofar as Metro Vancouver projections are set to worsen the housing shortage. Also of note, Metro Vancouver projections are based on households, even though they mislabel them as “dwelling units”. To get to dwelling targets we add another 5% to allow for moving vacancies and other frictions.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-27-housing-targets/index_files/figure-html/housing-targets-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Here we break out the current shortfall estimated above, the current Metro Vancouver projections, our scaling up of Metro Vancouver projections by estimated shortfall to current stock, plus a factor to convert Metro Vancouver’s (mislabelled) household projections into dwelling projections. And voilà! Housing Targets!</p>
<p>This is all pretty rough and we have given up estimating the extent of our uncertainties here. Adding to those we already discussed we now add uncertainties in Metro Vancouver projections, and uncertainties how to adjust them for their methodological flaws. Since 2018 prices have climbed significantly, but so have construction costs. Incomes have also increased, as have interest rates. It would be worthwhile to redo this analysis for today’s conditions, while also paying more attention to compositional effects that lead to some curious quirks in the CMHC report. But that goes beyond the scope of a blog post.</p>
<p>For now this gives a baseline for planning to work with. It’s probably not realistic to expect half a million new dwelling units across Metro Vancouver, built in the places where people want to live. It takes time for the construction labour force to adjust, and redevelopment is contingent on properties selling. But it gives us a 10-year target to work toward.</p>
</section>
<section id="non-market-housing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-market-housing">Non-market housing</h2>
<p>To close this section we note that we are talking about overall numbers, and using market mechanisms to estimate housing targets. People living in non-market housing don’t enter in the <em>excess price</em> metric we calculate as our wedge (renters enter implicitly, though not directly). But non-market housing is counted as part of the overall housing supply, and thus enters into our housing targets. The <em>excess price</em> metric implies that prices for new housing would fall by roughly 50% in Metro Vancouver, more in some sub-regions and less in others, and while these price reductions and related rent reductions would be expected to propagate in some way through the entire housing spectrum, it is not clear how exactly this would transform the lower end of the market. Nor is it clear the lower end of the market could meet everyone’s needs. We expect there would likely still be people left in inadequate or unaffordable housing, where dedicated non-market housing or cash supplements should be directed. But we also expect that alleviating overall housing shortages <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/headway/houston-homeless-people.html">makes this work a lot easier to do</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally after addressing how much overall housing is needed, we’d return to the second part of our question to ask how much non-market housing is needed to insure everyone has access to housing. We have some ideas for how to go about this, involving calculating the effects of meeting overall targets on rent distributions by housing type, and drawing upon household characteristics to figure out what proportion of households wouldn’t find needs met by these new distributions. But that involves a lot more work and assumptions, and we’ll leave it for another post.</p>
<p>For now we’ll note that the work and assumptions involved in jointly assessing overall housing targets and specifically non-market housing targets point toward a persistent shortcoming in many current housing needs assessments. A lot of housing needs estimates simply look at how the need of the current population is met by the available housing. Sometimes assessments are pegged to household income brackets and look at how many households in each bracket face housing struggles. This is useful for understanding how people are doing in the current housing environment, but only of limited use when coming up with housing targets, where projection into the future includes people not currently resident in the region and involves a lot of moving parts operating within a broader and interconnected housing system.</p>

<h1>Upshot</h1>
<p>Setting defensible housing targets is hard, but necessary under our <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2023/02/07/a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/">current planning and development regime</a>. If we’re going to essentially <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/02/06/a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/">restrict all new multi-family housing by default, only allowing it after lengthy, expensive, and uncertain discretionary processes</a>, then we really need targets to ensure we’re still building enough housing. In short, housing is good and we need it. We approach the construction of overall targets as a means of preventing planning from restricting the housing we need.</p>
<p>Here in Metro Vancouver, defensible housing targets suggest we need a lot more housing. Looking forward, we’ll need a lot more housing just to keep things from getting worse. And we’ll need a lot more than that in order to make things better. We might not be able to hit our targets, but we should aim high. The more housing we build, both market and non-market, the better things will get.</p>
<p>Of course our targets hinge on our values as <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/02/26/human-rights-yimbyism/">human rights YIMBYs</a> that housing is good, that people have a right to it, that allowing people to gather together in cities is good, and that new neighbours bring their own kind of amenity. Others may have different values, and consequently arrive at different targets. For instance, some people believe cities, acting as either private corporations or miniature states, have a right to exclude people to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2281955">maximize utility</a> for their current shareholders/property owners/citizens. This kind of thinking <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/06/20/metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/">has become entrenched within current procedures</a> in our planning and development regimes even as technocratic language obscures the underlying values argument. We can look around at access to housing across the region and see where our current procedures lead.</p>
<p>In short: Housing is good, actually. Our targets should reinforce that point, making it simpler and easier to add housing, especially in places where people want to live. In the long term we want to get away from targets and return to a housing system with ample outright capacity. Housing targets are a bridge to get us there from our current planning regime. We will still need projections, but their role will transition to give rough ranges of what to expect to ensure we have enough outright capacity, and make smart decisions around infrastructure planning.</p>

<section id="update-additional-scenario-on-effective-cost-assumptions-september-25-2023" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="update-additional-scenario-on-effective-cost-assumptions-september-25-2023">Update (additional scenario on effective cost assumptions, September 25, 2023)</h2>
<p>One caveat on our analysis above is that we added in a sizable land component to the marginal cost of housing. This may not be necessary, in a market where the amount of housing is not constrained by municipal regulation (maybe where municipalities even encourage more housing!) a developer could build up until the marginal (social) cost of production, including profit, equals the the price the housing sells for. The additional “land component” of 20% was added rather ad-hoc, with the implicit understanding that when we are far away from equilibrium developers would not just build one more floor but many, and the effective marginal cost of adding these floors is higher than the marginal cost of adding just one floor. This could also capture costs associated with externalities of increasing population density, which also increases the cost of providing services that may not be captured at the current level of DCC/DCLs (assuming for simplicity those are set properly to cover only the current incremental cost of new construction). Lastly this accounts for risk, where developers may opt to build below the economically optimal height to avoid running the risk of not being able to recover all their costs if it turns out that prices are lower than anticipated at the time of completion.</p>
<p>The 20% estimate is probably at the high end of the range of what could reasonably be expected here. To complement our previous estimates we re-run the analysis where we assume supply can be effectively added at 10% above current marginal cost of supply.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, we start out with a wedge that is ~10% larger.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-27-housing-targets/index_files/figure-html/excess-price2-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This in turn gives significantly higher estimates of current shortfall.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-27-housing-targets/index_files/figure-html/housing-shortfall2-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>When spacing this out over 10 years this leads to again significantly higher 10 year targets, with higher baselines but also higher correction to the projection housing demand.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-27-housing-targets/index_files/figure-html/housing-targets2-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Assuming supply can be effectively added at the current marginal cost would locate more than half of BC’s current dwelling shortfall in Metro Vancouver, and accordingly finds a higher dwelling shortfall especially in the more expensive cities within Metro Vancouver. This is probably a more realistic estimate of targets to return the market to a condition where the total amount of housing is not overly constrained by municipal restrictions limiting new housing construction.</p>

<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2023/06/21/metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>In a previous post we looked at the history of <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2023/02/06/a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/">planning regimes in the City of Vancouver</a>. Similar shifts happened in other municipalities in the region, and they also fit into a broader shift in planning at the regional level. Regional level planning is less concerned with zoning and the regulations that govern housing production, and more with coordinating services and the broader guiding principles applying to municipal policies. Service provision means regional level planning has an interest in keeping track of population. But how far does that interest go?</p>
<p>First let’s take a look at our history of regional population growth, shown here for the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). The Vancouver CMA now matches governing level of the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) recently rebranded as Metro Vancouver, but this has not always been the case. Moreover, even the Vancouver CMA boundaries have changed, experiencing an expansion in 1971, and we break the census count timelines at 1966 based on the respecitve census geographies.</p>

<p>Some of the intricacies of measuring population, let alone projecting its future growth, become evident in this graph. Geographic extent, census count procedures, and population estimation methods all matter. We also note that the growth rate has varied, and shows several inflection points, including a slowing of the growth rate in 1971, an increase in the growth rate in 1986 and a slowing again in 1996. This population history brings us back to consideration of the history of regional planning.</p>
<p>Regional planning bodies sit between the provincial and municipal levels. Their structure is governed by the province. In BC they have been set up as <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/local-governments/facts-framework/systems/regional-districts">federations of municipalities</a>, with dedicated staff responding largely to the politicians elected to represent each contained municipality. The Lower Mainland Regional Planning Board (LMRPB) began operating in this capacity in 1949, mostly in response to catastrophic flooding all along the Fraser River the year prior. The province set up regional districts more broadly in 1965, but then subdivided the LMRPB in 1969 into four separate regional district governments, including the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD), recently renamed Metro Vancouver (more on <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/about-us/governance-structure">Metro Vancouver governance here</a>).</p>
<p>There are several good overviews of the history of Vancouver regional planning, including Metro Vancouver’s own <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/library/HarryLashLibraryPublications/Creating-Our-Future-1994.pdf">Creating Our Future: The History, Status, and Prospects for Regional Planning</a>, Tom Hutton’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13563475.2011.591144">look at the regional planning between 1976 to 2011</a> and the entertaining if somewhat more partisan <a href="https://douglas-mcintyre.com/products/9781553652571">City Making in Paradise</a>. The latter, written by former mayor and NDP premier Mike Harcourt in conjunction with Metro planner Ken Cameron and reporter Sean Rossiter, makes the case that the shift from LMPRB to GVRD was politically motivated and consequential, especially for planning around ports. In this post we want to take a different angle with a focus on housing. In particular we want to look at shifts in planning objectives in relation to housing that occurred between the 1966 regional plan (under the LMRPB) and the 1975 regional plan (under the GVRD). We’ll argue that these shifts were similarly consequential.</p>

<section id="the-1966-official-regional-plan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-1966-official-regional-plan">The 1966 Official Regional Plan</h2>
<p>In 1952, shortly after the creation of the LMRPB with its mandate to “prepare plans for the physical development of the region,” the Planning Commission published <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/library/LibraryPublications/The_Lower_Mainland_Looks_Ahead_1952.pdf">The Lower Mainland looks ahead</a> report. It describes the basic conditions of the lower mainland, a largely resource-driven economy at the time, and lays out some principles to guide development. After collecting considerably more information in conjunction with consultation, the work of the LMRPB accumulated in the <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/library/LibraryPublications/Official_Regional_Plan_For_The_Lower_Mainland_Planning_Area_1966.pdf">1966 Offical Regional Plan</a>, which established a “guide for development, both public and private, in the Lower Mainland Region.”</p>
<p>The objectives of the 1966 LMRPB plan are laid out in the table above. The parts pertaining to residential development laid out a broad plan where development should be encouraged, e.g.&nbsp;the development of “compact regional towns” with surrounding areas developed via “staged expansion with subdivision”. Subdivision of land was to be strictly limited in absence of water pipe and sewerage extension. At the same time the plan forbid developments in the floodplains, except in parts “committed to urban development through early settlement, in which case further development for URBAN uses shall be contingent upon floodproofing.” The plan had little to say directly about housing relative to other “URBAN” uses of land, except that areas considered for expansion of the urban footprint should not be allowed to develop into multi-family residential forms. Within the existing urban footprint, municipal authorities were left to do pretty much as they wished, at least as long as they invested in protection from flooding.</p>
<p>The authority of the LMRPB was to be short-lived. The Lower Mainland Regional Planning Board dissolved in 1968 and was replaced with the four regional bodies spanning the Fraser Valley, with the largest being the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD). These bodies would collaborate on a <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/library/LibraryPublications/Plan_for_the_Lower_Mainland_of_British_Columbia_1980.pdf">1980 Plan</a>, but otherwise governed their affairs separately. The end of the LMRPB may have followed simply from the expanding regulatory interests and capacities of the province, or it may have derived from the personal animosity of the premier at the time, as in the telling of <a href="https://douglas-mcintyre.com/products/9781553652571">City Making in Paradise</a>. Either way, the premiership of W.A.C. Bennett wouldn’t last much longer than the LMRPB as the 1970s ushered in the tumultuous rise of new political powers both in the City of Vancouver (TEAM) and across the province of British Columbia (NDP).</p>

<section id="the-1975-livable-region-plan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-1975-livable-region-plan">The 1975 Livable Region Plan</h2>
<p>The new GVRD began their planning efforts within a very different context than the old LMRPB. The new political parties in the province and local municipalities rode to power in part on the strength of resistance to development (see our discussion of the rise of a <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2023/02/07/a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/">Spot Discretionary Regime in Vancouver</a>). The NDP solidified the protections for agricultural land encouraged by the old LMRPB through formalization of the Agricultural Land Reserve, constraining further outward expansion of the region’s urban footprint. The culture within planning had changed as well, embracing many of the critiques launched by reformers like Jane Jacobs, and turning toward public consultation for solutions. Local activist planners like Walter Hardwick and <a href="https://viewpointvancouver.ca/2015/11/13/the-legacy-darlene-marzari/">Darlene Marzari</a> circulated between academic, professional, and political positions. Of note, where the leading edge of the Baby Boom had just turned 20 by the time of the 1966 report, their demographic impact on housing demand was really picking up by the 1970s. Into this new moment, the GVRD launched a new <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/about-us/metro-vancouver-library">consultation-heavy</a> planning process, culminating in the <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/about-us/Documents/livable-region-1976-1986-proposals-to-manage-the-growth-of-greater-vancouver.pdf">1975 Livable Region Plan</a>, intended as a blueprint to carry metropolitan Vancouver forward from 1976 to 1986. Housing would figure prominently. But the document would place fears about growth front and centre in its introduction.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We have tried to make proposals rooted in the hopes and fears of the people living here who seem to have a modest but challenging dream: let Greater Vancouver continue to be a good place to live. Their fear is that growth will spoil the Region, and that governments at all levels cannot or will not act to maintain livability in the face of growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the 1975 Plan pointedly avoided a statement on whether growth was good or bad, GVRD staff began presenting policy proposals to their Board in 1974 for “bringing the overall growth rate under control.” The 1975 Plan summarized the bases for a shift in direction.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Based on this series of studies, public meetings and seminars, the Board has adopted the following policy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall Growth Rate: From a policy of accepting all growth that comes, to a policy which recognizes that the overall rate of growth is capable of being controlled, but not by GVRD alone.</li>
<li>Sharing Growth: From a policy of accepting natural growth trends to a policy of determining the amount of growth each part of the Region can accommodate.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These key shifts show up in the first strategy forwarded by the 1975 Plan. The “growth targets” represented not aspirations, so much as caps, and the plan called very explicitly to limit population growth by rationing housing throughout the region. The plan elaborates on point 1 from the table up top:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The overall growth of the Region to 1986 should be shared among the municipalities on a rational basis. We propose population growth targets for each part of Greater Vancouver, based on 13 livability concerns such as the preservation of open space and recreation areas, minimizing travel time and inconvenience, and minimizing disruption to existing communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast, strategy point 2 signalled a milder departure from the previous emphasis on economic development by subjugating jobs growth to the location of residential developments, indicating an eagerness to fragment the job market. As assessed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13563475.2011.591144">Tom Hutton</a> “the idea of ‘deflecting’ office development from downtown Vancouver to the suburban RTCs suggested a naïve understanding of how commercial property markets operate, and more specifically the power of agglomeration in office location”. Points 3, 4, and 5 connected even more closely with prior goals from the 1966 LMRPB plan.</p>
</section>
<section id="transforming-a-projection-into-a-gate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transforming-a-projection-into-a-gate">Transforming a Projection into a Gate</h2>
<p>In short order, the population targets of the 1975 GVRD Plan took a relatively crude set of population projections, lowered them, and turned them into a gate to control growth. The targets were couched in pseudo-scientific language and mechanisms that partially obscured the severity of the shift to population control as a objective of metro planning. The “rational basis” for the targets took the annual population growth rate between 1971 and 1976 (using population estimates for 1976) of 3.2% and reduced it to 2.1% for the next 10 years. The document grouped municipalities into sub-regions of the GVRD, and compared 1971 population counts from the census with estimated 1976 population estimates to project out “trends” to 1986.</p>
<p>The actual data work in the document remains opaque; the “trend” extrapolations given in the document follow neither geometric nor arithmetic population growth trends, with the region-wide growth rate explicitly fixed to the lower rate of 2.1% and the municipal trend adjusted to fit this in some obscure way that results in an increased trend for some municipalities and a decreased rate for others.</p>
<p>The 1975 Plan then proceeded to modify the regional trends according to ten criteria “based on opinions of the GVRD Planning Committee and the reports of the citizens’ advisory Policy Committees” that were translated into numeric population targets “with the help of a computer program”, but did so in way that left the (previously lowered) overall projected population for 1986 unchanged.</p>
<p>The plan did not explicitly translate these population targets into housing targets. The conversion of the population targets to housing units and floor space quotas was left to individual municipalities. Strikingly, at the same time as the plan set growth targets it also acknowledged a worsening of housing outcomes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the last few years we have had a shortage of affordable housing, especially rental housing. This shortage has helped to push up rents and house prices, and caused an increase in doubling-up and crowding of households in existing accommodation. These effects strike hardest at the poor, people who are in large part not newcomers to Vancouver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1975 Plan presciently continued to explain how reducing growth via their new gates would adversely affect housing outcomes, in particular for lower income groups.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trying to keep out newcomers by reducing the amount of housing will only hurt our own lowest income groups more, and perhaps not stop very many newcomers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modeled on consultation only with existing residents, the 1975 Plan emphasized that it was not concerned with the fate of newcomers. But limiting housing would also hit the existing population.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Such a policy would make Greater Vancouver a lot less livable for many people who are already here, and our objective is to maintain livability for all who live in Vancouver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report did not provide a clear justification for how it arrived at its overall population projections, other than applying a lower growth rate than observed in the recent past. It justified the reduction with concerns about population growth while acknowledging that reducing housing development would hurt housing affordability, in particular for lower income people, which it claimed constituted a concern. To resolve this apparent contradiction the 1975 Plan suggested that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>regional and municipal officials can work with senior levels of government to influence immigration and other factors which affect overall population growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More explicitly it suggested the federal government should:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li>work with provincial and regional governments to create a settlement policy for the country, just as the Regional District is working with its municipalities to develop a settlement policy in the Region,</li>
<li>co-ordinate immigration policy with the national settlement policy when it is developed,</li>
<li>work to create growth centres outside of the fast-growing metropolitan areas, as part of the population settlement policy,</li>
<li>finance and participate in a study with the GVRD on the impact of immigration on the Vancouver Region.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Of note, these suggestions for controlling the growth of cities look strikingly similar to those put forward by Harvey Molotch’s influential <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~hoganr/SOC%20602/Spring%202014/Molotch%201976.pdf">“Growth Machine”</a> paper within Sociology, published in 1976.</p>
<p>All of the work of the 1975 Plan happened against a backdrop of already high housing prices, signalling pent-up demographic demand for housing both from suppressed households in the region as well as migration pressures. Planning ahead for this demographic demand would suggest scaling up the development of housing. But the 1975 Livable Region Plan did just the opposite, attempting to install a gate to control further growth.</p>
<p>The idea that the federal government should adjust immigration policy to fit the regional preference to build less housing, instead of fitting the housing strategy to accommodate federal immigration policy, is a theme in media and municipal policy-making that carries on through this day. As noted above, there were a lot of things happening in the 1970s, including a resurgent neo-Malthusianism directly referenced by the 1975 Plan. But it is possibly no coincidence that local calls to adjust federal immigration policy grew in conjunction with a more open shift in immigration policy and the arrival of many more immigrants from outside Europe and the United States as evidenced in the graph below showing the makeup of the foreign-born population in each census year.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-20-metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/index_files/figure-html/immigrants_by_place_of_birth-1.png" width="1200"></p>

<section id="targets-vs-actuals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="targets-vs-actuals">Targets vs actuals</h2>
<p>Did the gate work? It’s always useful to check, after the fact, how targets compare to actual population growth. While municipal representatives to the GVRD expressed supported for limiting growth, it’s not clear the targets were at all binding, especially after regional plans were effectively nullified through provincial restraint bills in the 1980s. Perhaps more pressingly, there were no clear guides for how to translate population targets into housing approvals, especially given instability in household sizes. It’s doubtful any authorities adequately monitored how population aging and changes in family formation and childbearing implied more housing was going to be needed for every future person added to the population in the years to come.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-20-metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/index_files/figure-html/household_size_timeline-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Where an average dwelling might have contained nearly 4 residents in Canada in the 1960s, this figure dropped below 3 by the 1980s. While households were smaller in urban areas like Metro Vancouver, the fall in household size was similar precipitous in the lead up to 1976. But by 1986, household size began to rise again, with sizes in Metro Vancouver ultimately rising above the average for the rest of Canada (<a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/10/03/still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/">see also our post on age-specific household maintainer rates during these years</a>). Overall it’s likely that the fuzziness of the methodology to set population targets, and the lack of guidance on how to translate these into housing units and approvals, led to all sub-regions, with the exception of the very small “Other” region (not shown in the graph below), failing to meet even their lowered GVRD targets by wide margins.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-20-metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/index_files/figure-html/gvrd_targets_1986-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>In conjunction with the planned reduction relative to the pre-1971 growth rate this further reduced the average annual growth between 1971 and 1986 that was actually achieved to 1.4%. One interpretation might be that the gate worked even better than planned. But many things were happening in the 1970s and 1980s, including rapid inflation, enormous hikes in interest rates, and a major recession that hit BC especially hard. So it’s probably too soon to celebrate or condemn the success of the Livable Region Plan’s gate.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subsequent-regional-growth-strategies">Subsequent regional growth strategies</h2>
<p>If the 1975 Plan attempted to transform a projection into a gate, subsequent plans would take that gate and elaborate upon it until they could pretend it was a projection again. The initial haphazard way in which population trends were projected into the future, and then linked to targets, was partially professionalized in subsequent iterations of the regional growth strategy and related planning documents. At the same time, equity concerns largely shifted from broader social equity to more specific inter-municipal equity. Regional planning documents downplayed recognition and concern that limiting housing could have large negative impacts on affordability, particularly for low income households. Illustrating these shifts, the 1996 GVRD plan attempted to take changing household sizes into account, but also took <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/about-us/Documents/livable-region-strategic-plan.pdf#page=27">population trends and targets</a> a step further to estimate “growth capacities” out to 2021, including separate capacities for ground-oriented and apartment households. The 1996 GVRD plan took a more pessimistic view of the prospects for controlling growth, but slowing and/or managing growth remained on the table, with little discussion of negative consequences.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Experience around the world has shown that population growth cannot be stopped by rules and regulations. Even slowing growth is a challenge with many possible consequences. However, we are able to manage growth in a way that preserves the essential qualities that make our region such a special place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from minor shifts, the basic methods of projection and target setting have remained the same through the present. The Regional Growth Strategy does not engage with the question of demand for housing, but <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/services/regional-planning/Documents/metro-vancouver-growth-projections-methodology-report.pdf">instead relies upon mechanistic population “projections” that naively extrapolate past patterns</a>. In doing so, the <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/04/26/planning-for-scarcity/">Regional Growth Strategy continues to systematically enshrine past housing shortages and worsen them</a>, although the technical machinery to do this has advanced considerably.</p>
<p>In effect, the technical machinery excludes everyone pushed out of the region in the past. The only ones who count are those who make it into the region and manage to stay in the region despite the growth reduction efforts of local authorities. The technical machinery also casts realized household size as perfectly matched to preferences. Everyone stuck living with their parents’ or in bad roommate situations is treated the same as if they were living out their dreams.</p>

Lack of regional coordination was linked to a permissive development regime through City and Metro’s earliest years. The City shifted in a more regulated regime first, adopting zoning as a key tool by 1931, primarily aimed at coordinating growth. The Region organized only after the 1948 flood, similarly focused on coordinating growth for major infrastructure. The City shifted to a Spot Discretionary Regime, whereby development was much more tightly controlled by 1972. Metro shifted toward a similar controlling stance, attempting to install gates to slow and manage growth, right around the same time.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="managing-regional-allocation">Managing regional allocation</h2>
<p>The gating work done by Metro Vancouver projections also remains tied to separate and managed allocation for each municipality. Allocations are partially informed by past trends, but also by evolving calculations of “land use capacity” linked to municipal community plans and inter-municipal negotiation. The results are complex, retaining some focus on the encouragement of compact urban communities (where we <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/services/regional-planning/Documents/metro-2050.pdf#page=29">still see targets</a>), but also essentially guiding housing and population growth into regions where there’s the least political resistance instead of focusing on demand for where people want to live. Exclusive and exclusionary municipalities are effectively encouraged to stay that way.</p>
<p>To understand the fundamental problem with how the Metro Vancouver growth strategy allocates housing targets to municipalities, consider how the <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/services/regional-planning/Documents/regional-growth-strategy-adopted-by-greater-vancouver-regional-district-board.pdf#page=74">Regional Growth Strategy to 2040 projections</a> in the following municipalities stack up against actual growth over a ten year time period. Here we gloss over the issue with census undercounts, implicitly assuming that the ratio of the undercounts in each municipality did not change between the 2011 and 2021 censuses.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-06-20-metro-vancouver-planning-regimes/index_files/figure-html/gvrd_2021_muni_porjections-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Take Metro Vancouver A, the area around UBC. Population growth was substantially higher than projected, and this is entirely due to more housing getting built than projected. For the City of Vancouver, population growth came out very close to projections. Does that mean that Metro Vancouver properly estimated demand to live in the City of Vancouver? Of course not, prices and rents rose enormously over this period. It’s simply because the City of Vancouver built as much housing as Metro projected it would; it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Similarly for West Vancouver, Port Moody, Port Coquitlam, and Coquitlam the population came in significantly short of projections not because people don’t want to live there, but because the municipalities failed to build the projected amount of housing.</p>
<p>This raises two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Why stick to flawed methodology for projections?</li>
<li>Do projections and targets from the Regional Growth Strategy matter, or do municipalities do what they want anyway?</li>
</ol>
<p>We will look at these in reverse order.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-rgs-projections-matter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-rgs-projections-matter">Do RGS projections matter?</h2>
<p>The Regional Growth Strategy housing targets aren’t binding for municipalities. While <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/08/01/on-vancouver-population-projections/">some go over the targets, most stay below their targeted growth</a>. Metro Vancouver does at times exert pressure if it feels that contained jurisdictions divert too much from their targets, as happened when <a href="https://www.straight.com/article-354743/vancouver/ubc-landuse-plan-revisited">UBC wanted to build more housing than what the Regional Growth Strategy called for</a>. But there is little Metro Vancouver can do if municipalities decide to ignore targets. So how do they matter in maintaining and reinforcing our housing shortage if it all come down to municipalities?</p>
<p>While it’s up to the municipalities how much housing to build, the Regional Growth Strategy plays two important roles. Individual municipalities have little chance to make a serious dent in the housing crisis by increasing the rate at which they add housing. It’s an uphill battle to start with given how large our <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/blog/2022/canadas-housing-supply-shortage-restoring-affordability-2030">housing deficit</a> is, but if other municipalities are pulling in a different direction it’s next to impossible. Regional coordination matters. And if regional targets are set to reinforce housing scarcity all bets are off. At the same time, the low regional housing targets give individual municipalities engaging in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2281955">fiscal zoning</a> cover to keep housing scarce in their municipality.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-stick-to-flawed-methodology">Why stick to flawed methodology?</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon that flawed methodology survives unquestioned for a long time. There is significant inertia inherent in established methods, and it can require concerted effort to overthrow them. In part it’s because technical detail helps wrap flaws up into an authoritative sounding package. But in part it’s also because the flawed projections have important defenders, serving a variety of roles for different groups involved. They enable staff to justify planning positions and point toward a source of authority and expertise; they enable politicians to begin negotiations over seemingly neutral starting projections while side-stepping very different views of the most desirable future, both between themselves and their constituents; finally, they enable both staff and municipal politicians to speak to provincial and federal governments in terms all parties can understand, even if they can’t agree upon desirable outcomes. This helps explain their inherent inertia. Even when they’re wrong, they can still be useful to the right people.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the broad availability of housing, and the ensuing improved housing affordability it would provide, is not a universal good. A large portion of the voting population does not feel the negative consequences of housing scarcity because they already have secure housing, and they might even like the feeling of observing their primary asset steadily appreciating in value.</p>
<p>The nature of Metro Vancouver planning is that it relies on the individual municipalities signing off on any agreement. In order to fix the flawed planning and data processes and put them on a path of more realistically assessing the interplay between housing and population/demographics, one first needs to more clearly separate the planning and data processes from the political processes. Politicians may well choose to vote to continue to constrain housing growth and perpetuate our housing shortage, but they should do so explicitly instead of hiding their values under flawed data work and technocratic language.</p>
</section>
<section id="upshot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upshot">Upshot</h2>
<p>Our focus in the post is on housing, and regional planning has an important role to play when it comes to coordinating planning for housing and population growth, especially in a heavily balkanized environment like Metro Vancouver (containing 21 municipalities, an electoral area, a First Nation Treaty Land, and, while not explicitly represented in Metro Vancouver planning processes, 16 First Nation reserves). We can see and clearly mark a regime change. Starting with plans from the 1970s, the GVRD moved away from coordinating for growth and toward gate management. This laid a strong foundation for housing scarcity, and Metro Vancouver has to this day continued to work toward perpetuating and deepening housing scarcity in the region through its projection and coordination work. While it is unclear how important the Metro Vancouver Regional Growth Strategies have been in coordinating municipal limits on housing development, they have at a minimum given cover to municipalities for perpetuating and deepening housing scarcity and spatial misallocation, shifting growth away from where people want to live.</p>
<p>The Province has already begun to look more closely at municipalities that have failed to accommodate more housing, and the inclusion on the <a href="https://subscriptions.cbc.ca/newsletter_static/messages/metromatters/2023-06-09/?cmp=subscription-centre_metromatters_vib-link">“naughty list”</a> of so many municipalities within Metro Vancouver should come as no surprise. But the regional planning body could also use an overhaul. A first step in reform should be reconfiguring the methods by which Metro Vancouver attempts to coordinate the housing targets of sub-regions. Past expert consultations (attended by one of the authors of this post) have identified problems with projections, making the key point that for a region with a severe housing shortage, housing development leads to population growth rather than the other way around. So far these critiques of Metro methods have not yet sunk in. Now might be a good time to shake things up.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2023/02/21/investing-in-definitions-and-framing/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>With last week’s CHSP release of data on the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=4610007001">investment status of residential properties</a> and the framing of the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/46-28-0001/2023001/article/00001-eng.htm">accompanying article</a> there has been a lot of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/housing-investors-canada-bc-1.6743083">rather uninformed</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-investment-property-1.6739784">misleading</a> news coverage.</p>
<p>The misleading reporting, combined with sometimes plainly wrong statements by people quoted in the news coverage, on one hand highlights the poor understanding of housing in the public discourse. On the other hand it highlights the importance of providing careful framing with data releases. In general it is good practice to accompany a data release with a brief analysis to provide framing and context. Analysts close to the raw data will have a much better understanding of what the data is measuring and can properly frame the data. Unfortunately, StatCan fell short of doing so, and the overview analysis provided by StatCan itself contains a number of problems. Given the public attention this has gotten it’s probably worthwhile to take a look at what the data does and does not say, and to correct some of the misinterpretations that have been circulating.</p>
<section id="the-trouble-with-the-definitions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-trouble-with-the-definitions">The trouble with the definitions</h2>
<p>For any data release it’s important to understand the definitions underlying the categorization in the data. Central to this release is how “investors” are defined.</p>
<p>In common language, “investors” are typically defined by motivation and expectation. The New Oxford American Dictionary defines “investor” as: “a person or organization that puts money into financial plans, property, etc. with the expectation of achieving a profit.” Statistics Canada does not have access to motivations or expectations through the CHSP program. This suggests they probably should have considered different language in this study, and at the very least have been prepared for a lot of misinterpretation in media coverage.</p>
<p>Rather than exploring motivation or expectation, we get a definition of which property owners are considered “investors” from Statistics Canada that simply groups by point-in-time category. So investors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>for-profit businesses</li>
<li>governments</li>
<li>individuals not found resident in the province</li>
<li>individuals resident in the province owning more than one property</li>
<li>individuals resident in the province owning a property with more than one residence</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to pause for a moment here to ponder the choice to include governments as investors. Governments do indeed own a fair amount of property (see, for instance, the <a href="https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/city-owned-properties/information/">City of Vancouver’s vast holdings</a>), but it’s odd to speak of governments as investors. To be sure, they rent out properties and receive incomes on them, but usually holdings have to do with planning objectives and other government purposes.</p>
<p>Stranger yet, we’re told governments are combined with for-profit businesses in reporting, and, “Given the predominance of businesses in this category, they will simply be referred to as “business” in what follows.” This is an odd choice, and surprisingly sloppy coming from StatCan. A <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221110/dq221110c-eng.htm">StatCan article from November of 2022</a> initially reporting on business and government ownership, for instance, retained both in the title of the category to avoid misinterpretation in collapsing the two. The collapse of the distinction here seems like a red flag by comparison, especially within a context where “investors” are likely to be interpreted as uniquely profit oriented in media coverage.</p>
<p>What of other groups included? Statistics Canada is implicitly making some very strong assumptions here about who is profit motivated and who isn’t. Purchasing a home for a family member to use? Investor. Resident homeowner basing retirement plans on best time to cash out their equity? Non-investor. Vacation home owner? Investor (but only if their primary residence is also owned, they’re not an investor if their primary residence is rented). Even in these few examples, we can see how temporal considerations might also matter. In practice, property owners regularly shift their motivations and relationships to properties through time, problematizing their neat division into “investors” or “non-investors” assessed at any particular point in time. Similarly, organizations like non-profits, automatically exempt from the definition of investor here, often run some housing as market housing, redirecting profits to support subsidies for other housing.</p>
<p>Overall, we can cut Statistics Canada some slack here in laying out their categorical definitions insofar as <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/06/30/a-brief-history-of-canadian-real-estate-investors/">they’re not the only ones making these assumptions</a>. But these assumptions should be treated critically and carefully, ideally making them explicit by discussion of their pros and cons. Here StatCan can do a lot better, and usually does.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada moves on from defining categories of investors to defining <em>investment properties</em>. This adds a new layer of complication insofar as matching owner categories to property categories is tricky. After all, single owners can hold multiple properties (part of the definition used for “investors”). Moreover single properties can have multiple owners and contain multiple dwellings. Grouping properties by buildings doesn’t help us here, and in fact adds to the complexity insofar as single properties can have multiple buildings, and single buildings can contain multiple properties (legally structured through condominium or strata legislation). Here all the complexity of matching owners to properties to dwellings gets swept up into three new categories: <em>investment properties</em>, <em>owner-occupied investment properties</em>, and <em>non-investment properties</em>. To simplify:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>non-investment property</strong> is a property with a single dwelling unit which is either
<ul>
<li>the primary residence of at least one of the owners, or</li>
<li>the sole property of each of the owners, all of which residing somewhere in the same province</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An <strong>owner-occupied investment property</strong> is a property with multiple dwelling units that is the primary residence of at least one of the owners.</li>
<li>An <strong>investment property</strong> is everything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the confusion in the media stems from the distinction between <em>investment property</em> and <em>non-investment property</em> remaining ambiguous about how the property is actually used, as we have already seen in the example of vacation properties above. Consider how a property with a single dwelling unit that is rented out could be classified as either one. Same for a property that is left empty.</p>
<p>The property use that the definition is less ambiguous about is if the property is in some way owner-occupied. In that case it is not solely an <em>investment property</em>, but it could be either a <em>non-investment property</em> or an <em>owner-occupied investment property</em>. Here adding a separate suite, often known as a “<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-a-granny-flat-1695933%22">granny flat</a>, automatically shifts a property into investment status, even if the owner’s granny moves in, or if nobody moves in and it’s still used as part of the living area of the main owner-occupied unit.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t matter a great deal if the stakes for being considered an <em>investor</em> didn’t seem so loaded with negative connotations. Maybe there is some real estate investment we want? In particular, many people have pointed out our housing shortage in Canada, where <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-canada-needs-a-lot-more-rental-housing-vancouver-is-leading-the-way/">we’re especially short on rentals</a>. The StatCan release notes that rental properties</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>contribute to the rental housing supply—and therefore meet the population’s need for rental housing – but that can also limit the number of properties available to buyers who intend to use it as a primary place of residence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the one hand this hints at a desire to elevate home ownership (by owner-occupiers), on the other hand it ignores the structure of single properties with multiple dwelling units, which cannot be made legally available for separate sale. And things get even more fuzzy when we get to purpose-built rental properties, which can produce misleading quirks in the data as we will discuss below.</p>
<p>Likely for this reason the press release has focused on <strong>houses</strong> defined as single-detached houses, semi-detached houses, row houses, and mobile homes, and <strong>condominium apartment</strong> property types when reporting statistics and comparing across jurisdictions. That does avoid some of the problems by excluding properties with multiple dwelling units. It filters out suited single family homes as well as large portions of purpose-built rental buildings, depending on how they are legally structured. But it’s still a statistic that can produce highly misleading results running counter to expectations of the casual reader, as we will explain further below, and CHSP fails to provide proper guidance.</p>
<p>In summary, we believe the definitions in this data release aren’t particularly useful in providing meaningful information about Canadian housing, and they aren’t sufficiently contextualized to provide a non-expert the means to adequately interpret the data.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-condominium-apartment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-condominium-apartment">What is a condominium apartment?</h2>
<p>Much of the news about the release has focused on condominium apartments. Colloquially these are often referred to simply as “condos”, but there are some important differences between the colloquial understanding and the formal definition by StatCan.</p>
<p><strong>Condominium</strong> refers to the <em>legal form</em> of ownership, also called <strong>strata</strong> in some parts of the country, which divides air parcels or land (“bare land strata”) so it can be sold and owned separately while some elements are held in common ownership. It makes owning individual apartment units possible, but also applies to many semi-detached houses (also know colloquially as “duplex” in some parts of the country), townhouses, bare land, as well most recently to imaginary units created solely for property tax purposes (“air parcels”).</p>
<p><strong>Apartment</strong> is a <em>structural type of dwelling</em>, which for StatCan refers generally to <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-500/001/98-500-x2021001-eng.cfm">structures with three or more units</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Condominium apartment</strong> consequently denotes the intersection of those two concepts, or as explained in the data release</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A condominium apartment refers to a set of living quarters that is owned individually, while land and common elements are held in joint ownership with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is important nuance to this, notably strata titled purpose-built rental apartments. These function and operate just like a purpose-built rental apartment structured legally as single ownership freehold, except it is legally structured as condominium, making each unit it’s separate legal entity but all units, while “owned individually” are held by the same owner. In the BC data underlying the CHSP building stock data, purpose-built rental apartment structured legally as condominium are identified by <em>actual use codes</em> 058 and 059, as opposed to actual use code 030 for condominium apartments which are generally sold and owned individually. The CHSP data does not distinguish between these two, and more importantly, fails to provide this context. This fundamentally challenges the framing provided in the overview analysis. The disparate treatment of purpose-built rental buildings depending on how they are legally structured causes problems when interpreting the data, in particular when the share of condominium titled purpose-built rental units among all condominium apartments varies across geographies.</p>
</section>
<section id="purpose-built-rental-buildings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose-built-rental-buildings">Purpose-built rental buildings</h2>
<p>One type of <em>investment property</em> that most people believe we should have more of is purpose-built rental buildings. These can be classified in a variety of ways, if the owner lives in one of the units it will be an <em>owner-occupied investment property</em>, if the owner does not live there it will be an <em>investment property</em>, and if the purpose-built rental building is legally structured as condominium, then the building will be classified as many <em>investment properties</em>, one for each dwelling unit (or strata lot). And this last point also shows how even simple statistics like the total share of properties that are investment properties in a given municipality can become very misleading.</p>
<p>To put it simply, big apartment buildings can show up as a lot of properties when structured into condominium, or a single property when structured like most purpose-built rental. But sometimes purpose-built rental is ALSO structured like condominium.</p>
<p>For example, focusing in on condominium apartments in the city of Vancouver as reported in the CHSP data 41.5% of the properties are classified as investment properties. But about 5% of these, roughly half of the 10.1% of the condominium apartment units owned by businesses, are in purpose-built rental apartments that happen to be legally structured as condominium. To give a specific example, the <a href="https://pw-yaletown.com">Peter Wall Yaletown at 1310 Richgards</a> is a rental building that is legally structured as condominium; each individual unit is <a href="https://www.bcassessment.ca/Property/Info/RDAwMDE0NURIMQ==">legally separated into it’s own strata lot</a>.</p>
<p>The public generally is not attuned to how a purpose-built rental building is legally structured, renters won’t be able to tell the difference unless they look it up in land title data.</p>
<p>In Vancouver this does not make that much of a difference, the share of non-purpose-built rental condominium apartments that are <em>investment properties</em> is 38.4%, not much different from the overall. Where it does make a difference is when <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/housing-investors-canada-bc-1.6743083">news articles and commentators talk up the business-owned condominium units</a> and fail to provide this context. After all, the condominium titled purpose-built rental apartments make up a significant share of the business-owned investment condos.</p>
<p>This problem of inadequate framing from StatCan get’s even more concerning when condominium titled purpose-built rental buildings make up a much larger share of overall condominium units. In London, Ontario, news reports took StatCan data at face value and headlined [“More than 86 per cent of London’s apartment condos are owned by investors: StatsCan”]((https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-investment-property-1.6739784) and falsely interpreted this as “a sign first-time buyers are being squeezed out of the market by investors, who are cashing in on the city’s severe undersupply of purpose-built rental apartments” instead of simply this being part of the purpose-built rental apartment supply. We can observe the echo of this by contextualizing the data with other data sources, in particular the Census and the CMHC condominium apartment secondary rental market survey.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that these other data sources differ in how data was categorized and what concepts are measured. The CMHC condominium apartment universe will exclude apartments that are classified as part of the primary rental market, so it will excluded condominium titled purpose-built rental apartments. On the other hand, the CMHC survey may have gaps that can skew the data.</p>
<p>Census data only reports on condominium units that are someone’s usual place of residence, so it will miss units that are unoccupied or occupied by temporarily present persons like students who return to live with their parents over summer. The Census determines the condominium status of a dwelling unit by asking the respondent, which will yield a different response than when accessing the legal status from administrative data. For example residents of bare land strata will often incorrectly report not being part of a condominium development. More important for our purpose, renters may be much less aware whether their rental home is condominium or not. In particular, renters in a purpose-built rental apartment will generally not know about the underlying legal structure of their building and self-report as not living in a condominium unit, whereas renters renting from individual owners within a condominium apartment generally report as living in condominium.</p>
<p>Despite of, and sometimes because of these differences, important information can be obtained by comparing these data sources.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-20-investing-in-definitions-and-framing/index_files/figure-html/chsp-cmhc-census-comparison-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We see that the overall CMHC condominium apartment universe is lower than the estimate of occupied (by usual residents) condominium apartment units from the Census, and the same is true for the number of rented condominium apartment units. Moreover, CHSP seems to under-estimate the owner-occupied stock, as should be expected given the biased error distribution inherent in the classification method. What stands out most, however, is the large difference in number of condominium apartment units in the CHSP data compared to the other two data sources, and that this can be to a very large extent attributed to business-owned condominium apartment units.</p>
<p>To confirm this we can compare the CMHC primary apartment rental market universe, which contains condominium titled purpose-built rental buildings, to the non-condominium apartment units identified in the census. One note here is that CMHC only counts structures with at least six rental units, while the census will identify buildings like single family homes with two secondary suites as apartments, so there are some differences to be mindful of.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-20-investing-in-definitions-and-framing/index_files/figure-html/cmhc-census-comparison-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The match between those two is quite strong, lending strong evidence to the hypothesis that a very large portion of the apartment condominium units are condominium titled purpose-built rental units.</p>
<p>To wrap this up we can put those together to understand the total apartment building stock, remembering that CMHC rental apartments only count units with six or more units.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-20-investing-in-definitions-and-framing/index_files/figure-html/chsp-cmhc-census-comparison-combined-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We added in data from the 2016 census for which we have information on how many apartment units were occupied by temporarily present persons or were unoccupied, to have a more complete picture of the entire apartment dwelling stock as classified by the census. Unfortunately we don’t have this data for the 2021 census at this point. The apartment stock has likely grown between the 2016 and 2021 census. This is meant for reference to contextualize the 2021 census data on the apartment units which are occupied by usual residents. Also note that “unoccupied” apartments <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/02/14/unoccupied-canada/">should not be confused with long term empty homes</a>.</p>
<p>This shows that the overall number of units estimated by CMHC and the census still line up reasonably well. the CHSP data only counts condominium apartments, and comparing to the other data sources we conclude that the overwhelming majority of <em>business investor</em> condominium apartments are in purpose-built rental buildings that neither CMHC, nor renters self-reporting in the census consider to be “condos.” Here the legal structure departs from the common-sense and practical definition. These units are not available for sale to residents, nor are they governed in a similar fashion to other condominium units. But the CHSP release ignores this distinction, correspondingly boosting estimates of investor-owned properties relative to if they were treated as singular purpose-built rental properties. The gap between the totals from the CHSP data and the other data sources is attributable to London also having purpose-built rental buildings that are not legally structured as condominium. Moreover, this highlights the distinction between <em>properties</em> and <em>dwelling units</em>, which makes it impossible to complete the comparison by adding in non-condominium apartment units in the CHSP data since the CHSP reports only on <em>properties</em> and does not allow to enumerate <em>dwelling units</em>.</p>

<section id="new-condo-stock" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-condo-stock">New condo stock</h2>
<p>To touch on a few other points, new condominium apartments will show up with higher rates of investor ownership in the CHSP data for several reasons. A simple one is unsold new inventory, which CHSP data will identify as investor units held by a business. Apart from that we generally see higher rates of transactions, and associated transactional vacancies, for new condominium apartment stock due to condominium apartment financing. Moreover, CHSP methods will likely under-estimate owner-occupiers for recent movers. This is basic context for anyone familiar with housing, making it surprising to see commentators trying to interpret this as a trend of increasing investor activity.</p>
</section>
<section id="emphasizing-foreignness" class="level1">
<h1>Emphasizing “foreignness”</h1>
<p>Another problematic aspect of the choice of definitions in the CHSP release is the prioritization of “foreignness” in the classification of investment properties. The issue arises when an <em>investment property</em> has multiple owners on title, with some living in different jurisdictions. When classifying such a property as <em>business and government owned</em>, <em>non-resident owned</em>, <em>out of province owned</em> or <em>in-province owned</em>, priority is given if at least one of the owners falls into these categories in this order. This further emphasizes the “foreignness” bias <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/01/26/rethinking-the-foreignness-of-owners-living-abroad/">inherent in CHSP’s owner matching methods</a>. This is in contrast to how non-residency was treated in previous releases, where it was based on majority ownership or reported as mixed or pure residency status of owners.</p>
<section id="takeaway" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>In the past CHSP has added valuable data to enhance the understanding of housing in Canada. Unfortunately this release didn’t. The definitions used in the CHSP data release aren’t particularly useful to gain meaningful insights into Canadian housing, and the CHSP release fails to properly contextualize the data. Given owners’ shifting motivations and relationships to properties, we maintain that the most important question is <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2018/12/17/how-are-condos-used/">how properties are used</a> rather than how they are owned. That’s not to say that the complexities and motivations of ownership aren’t also interesting. But they’re not well captured here.</p>
<p>The choices by CHSP on how to slice the data are questionable on multiple grounds. We’ve demonstrated special problems with regard to how strata titled purpose-built rental apartments show up. The complete lack of disclosure of this when discussing condominium apartment investors in the CHSP overview analysis is highly misleading and in some cases directly responsible for the outright wrong news coverage on this.</p>
<p>Other context missing from the release is <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/06/30/a-brief-history-of-canadian-real-estate-investors/">the historical data on multiple property ownership in Canada</a>, readily available from other statistical datasets at StatCan, that would greatly assist in interpreting the data.</p>
<p>To move the discussion forward CHSP should focus on providing strong framing with data releases to avoid the media and public misinterpreting the data. Likewise, media, commentators, and the broader public need to pay more attention to definitions.</p>
<p>This does not mean that ownership of housing is not important; it is. But the motivations, expectations, and practices of property owners can prove elusive, and regularly shift over the course of the same underlying legal relationship. This is a challenge for trying to match data up to definitions of investment, let alone increasingly popular conceptualizations of terms <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/08/13/commodity-and-keeping-it-in-the-family/">like commodification</a> and financialization as applied to housing, which rely upon strong assumptions about motivations, expectations, and practices. We’re very open to empirical contributions here, but ideally these contributions should directly address ambiguities and embrace underlying complexities, rather than sweeping them under the rug.</p>
<p>Lastly the meaning of ownership relative to renting is also complex and contingent. Aside from turning renters into owners, shifts in rental tenancy legislation can reset terms, providing access to the security many renters seek in ownership. In our mind a practical takeaway from the fact that many Canadians rent is that we should strengthen tenant rights, especially in the secondary market <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2022046-eng.htm">where most of the evictions happen</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Say you want to construct some multi-family housing in Vancouver. How long will it take? The answer is simple: it depends. There are many factors upon which it depends. Here we want to highlight one in particular: when you started.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it used to take a lot less time to build multi-family housing. There is reason to believe we could reduce that time again, but getting there involves gathering a better understanding of our current development regime, and placing it in historical perspective. We begin this process below, before diving deeper into two case studies of developments along Alma Street, located very near one another in space, but separated by some fifty years in start time. We’re going to look at the 14 storey rental building currently under construction at the intersection of Alma and Broadway, and the 12 storey rental building built in 1970 two blocks to the north at 3707 W 7th Ave.</p>

<p>But first some history! We’re going to divide time up into three rough regimes, which we call the <strong>Permissive Regime</strong>, the <strong>Zoning for Growth Regime</strong>, and the <strong>Spot Discretionary Regime</strong>.</p>
<section id="the-permissive-regime" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-permissive-regime">1886-1931 The Permissive Regime</h2>
<p>The City of Vancouver incorporated in 1886, and in its early years its development was relatively concentrated (mostly extending from the old site of Gastown to the East, and from the Railroad’s investments along Granville Street to the West). Bridges enabled leaps across the industrial sites surrounding False Creek, opening up further development to the South. The development regime quickly came under regulation after incorporation, but the form of regulation remained limited, with building permits linked to concerns about fire safety, gradually extending to building codes and the emergence of public health and nuisance regulations just starting to place limits on use (e.g.&nbsp;where a slaughterhouse could locate). Diverse forms of housing, including lots of multi-family, mixed within and beside other building forms and development often followed (and/or paid for the extension of) trolley lines. Early <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2019/10/24/mapping-four-blocks-of-vancouver-neighbourhood-change-1889-1920-or-so/">fire insurance maps</a> - <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2020/02/13/mapping-vancouvers-1907-trolley-ride/">and some of the first moving picture footage shot from a trolley</a> - demonstrate the diversity that accompanied Vancouver’s development boom.</p>
<p>Our first development regime began to shift through the 1920s and here we put it to bed by 1931, after a series of preliminary zoning laws were joined to a new plan for the City of Vancouver which, though not fully adopted, would prove enormously influential in ushering in a new, and much stronger regulatory regime. Before we fully got there, 21% of our current building stock was constructed, not counting buildings that got torn down and redeveloped since. To illustrate that legacy, we highlight three examples of pre-1931 buildings below.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/images/jackson_ave.png" alt="Jackson Ave" style="width:30%;margin: 0 5px"> <img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/images/lee_building.png" alt="Lee Building" style="width:30%;margin: 0 5px"> <img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/images/platform_7.png" alt="Platform 7" style="width:30%;margin: 0 5px"></p>
<p>What these buildings have in common is that they mix residential and commercial uses. They’ve also stood the test of time and have proven useful to this day, often earning protected heritage designations along the way. But the new, post-zoning regulatory regime made these kind of buildings illegal to construct anew across most of the city. In fact, the first two buildings were rendered illegal to get rebuilt in place under the initial 1931 zoning, and none of these three buildings would be legal to build under their current zoning today.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-zoning-for-growth-regime" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-zoning-for-growth-regime">1931-1972 The Zoning for Growth Regime</h2>
<p>The series of zoning laws put in place, starting with their preliminary version in 1927, were adopted largely to prevent the incursion of multi-family apartments into <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2016/11/02/media-coverage-of-my-book/">single-family residential districts</a>. But districting into zones also brought other changes, including efforts to more fully separate new development by land use, limiting mixing. Use districts were primarily divided into single-family &amp; duplex residential (RS, RT), multi-family apartment (RM), commercial (C), and industrial (I). Building permits, previously tied to meeting evolving safety and nuisance concerns, became tied to compliance with far more rigid zoning regulations, laying out much narrower lists of allowed uses.</p>
<p>The planner hired to assist Vancouver in its transition to a zoning regime, Harland Bartholomew, also planned ahead, <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/02/04/bartholomews-dot-destiny/">anticipating the future growth of the City</a>. Given extensive surveys of existing uses, Bartholomew imagined the City could accommodate about thirty years of growth under the zoning enacted through the 1920s and 1930s before revisiting its plan. Somewhere around 1960, he thought Vancouver would have to upzone, accommodating a new period of growth.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Vancouver began a modernization of its <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/3575.PDF">zoning code in 1956</a>, adopting new zoning district names and guidelines for metrics like Floor Space Ratios that would guide further development, and opening up new opportunities for tower form developments downtown. Through the 1960s, Vancouver would also begin to tentatively expand the range of its multi-family apartment (RM) districts, and also enable towers in these areas, upzoning to accommodate anticipated growth. But a backlash was brewing. A new council would sweep in with the 1972 election under the banner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electors%27_Action_Movement">TEAM</a>, a reformist party opposed to the spread of towers. They placed themselves at odds with the planning regime of the City, downzoned the multifamily apartment districts once more, and ushered in a new regime characterized by much tighter controls on development and more direct negotiation with City Hall.</p>
</section>
<section id="present-the-spot-discretionary-regime" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="present-the-spot-discretionary-regime">1972-Present: The Spot Discretionary Regime</h2>
<p>The downzoning of residential multifamily (RM) apartment districts helped usher in a new planning and development regime. Its key features included a) the loss of outright development potential on most lots, b) the rise of discretionary development potential with planner approval, and c) the rise of spot zoning through comprehensive development districts with full city council approval.</p>
<p>What we call the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em> emphasizes the two processes by which most development of new apartment buildings would proceed. Undeveloped old RM lots, intended to support apartment buildings, continued to see new construction, but generally at much lower heights and density than before and increasingly through discretionary approval processes within existing zoning, where developers had to get approval directly from planners before being able to proceed to getting a building permit. Some new RM lots were also added, expanding a few apartment districts. At the same time discretionary options to add residential units were opened up in other zones. These included, most prominently, the C (Commercial) zones along arterials, but also zones opened up by the rezoning of old industrial lands, especially around False Creek. These highly discretionary comprehensive neighbourhood zones (e.g.&nbsp;FCCDD &amp; FM-1) highlighted evolving priorities of the city. They would effectively transform over time into smaller, lot-specific comprehensive development (CD) zones through a practice known as spot zoning that involved the discretion of both city planners and city council as a whole. The City also began to charge increasing Development Cost Levies (DCLs) for new multi-family apartments, adding Community Amenity Contributions (CACs) for most re-zonings and correspondingly lowering property taxes for existing residents.</p>
<p>The <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em> has basically continued its evolution up into the present, for the most part progressively layering new rules, procedures, paperwork, and fees onto new multi-family apartment developments. Each of these layers has further oriented developers toward the bureaucracy and politics of City Hall, which have become increasingly important for developers to navigate to get anything built. It’s probably no accident that Vancouver’s housing crisis appears to have grown increasingly dire roughly in accordance with the evolution of the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em>. To this the Regime has responded not by loosening its hold over development, but instead by identifying new priorities to enforce through its controls. So it is that the City recently began to prioritize the construction of secured rental apartments, which is how we arrived, for instance, at the Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Program (MIRHPP), whereby developers are enabled density bonuses in exchange for building protected and moderately affordable rental apartments instead of condos.</p>
<p>Overall, our different development regimes link to distinct approval processes and paper trails. Our <strong>Permissive Regime</strong> simply required building permits adhering to relatively simple safety and nuisance guidelines. Our <strong>Zoning for Growth Regime</strong> required permits to be scrutinized for adherence to relatively strict zoning guidelines, but left a fair number of lots open for outright redevelopment. Our <strong>Spot Discretionary Regime</strong> saw the closure of most opportunities for outright development of multi-family apartments, shifting developers into often complex negotiations with the City, generally involving either gaining chief planner approval (discretion) or gaining full council approval (spot re-zoning) before moving ahead. The evaluation of lengthening paper trails also involved lengthening approval times and correspondingly lengthening development schedules. As suggested by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/opinion/economy-construction-productivity-mystery.html">Ezra Klein’s recent NYTimes column on the Construction Industry</a>, the shift in regimes isn’t unique to Vancouver. But instead of zooming out, let’s zoom in and return to the blocks containing our two nearby tower projects to compare what our <strong>Zoning for Growth Regime</strong> and our <strong>Spot Discretionary Regime</strong> look like on the ground!</p>
<p>For our case studies, we’re going to zoom in on the miniature Alma corridor between Broadway and 4th Avenue. Let’s have a look at how our regimes have played out via the history of zoning along this corridor. Here we draw heavily from our <a href="https://zoning.sociology.ubc.ca/historical/">CMHC-funded project on zoning history</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/index_files/figure-html/alma-parcels-zoning-1.png" width="1050"></p>
<p>The area is situated between Broadway to the south (bottom), 4th Avenue to the north (top), Alma St on the east (right), and Highbury on the west (left). West of Highbury Street start the Jericho Lands, which is the site of a future First Nation-led development by the <a href="http://mstdevelopment.ca/">MST development corporation</a>, a collaboration between the Musqueam Indian Band, Squamish Nation and Tsleil-Waututh Nation.</p>
<p>During our <strong>Permissive Regime</strong>, the Alma corridor remained relatively undeveloped, located on the outskirts at the border between the old City of Vancouver and the former self-styled residential municipality of Point Grey. Correspondingly very little remains from this era.</p>
<p>The amalgamation of Vancouver and Point Grey roughly coincided with the transition into our <strong>Zoning for Growth Regime</strong>. By 1931, Commercial hubs were zoned for Alma’s intersections with 4th and Broadway with a line of Apartment zoning between the two. The 1956 modernization of the zoning code (<a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/3575.PDF">Bylaw 3575</a>) replaced these with new C-2 (Commercial) and RM-3 (“Medium Density” Residential Multifamily) zones, installing restrictive RS (Single-Family) zones in the surrounding lots. At that time RM-3 allowed for a maximum height of 40ft and 1.3 FSR. But on July 4, 1961 council amended RM-3 zoning with <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/3926.PDF">bylaw 3962</a> to allow for heights up to 100ft and a change to maximum FSR that started out lower (1 FSR) but rewarded small site coverage, large lot area, and underground parking remaining below the building envelope in a formulaic and predictable way ultimately resulting in a significant FSR boost for towers. This zoning change enabled the 12 storey apartment building at 3707 W 7th Avenue to get built under outright zoning, as well as its mid-rise mate a block to the north.</p>
<p>This upzoning amounted to a significant expansion in developable floorspace across the city, leading to a development boom resulting in lots of new towers still standing today. It delineates two phases of the <em>Zoning for Growth Regime</em>: as thirty years of development filled out the initial plan, the modernization and 1960s upzoning “filled up the tank” of development capacity again.</p>
<p>But the towers prompted backlash, the rise of TEAM, and downzoning, setting up the transition to our <strong>Spot Discretionary Regime</strong>. Bylaw 4757, <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/4757.PDF">which came into effect in February 1974</a>, downzoned the Alma corridor’s RM-3 to RM-3A. RM-3A was still a relatively new zone at the time (<a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/4625.PDF">created in June 1972</a>), containing similar FSR limits to RM-3, but reduced height to 35ft outright, which at the discretion of the Planning Board could be increased to only 40ft. In March 1976 the city <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/4951.PDF">introduced the further restrictive RM-3A1 and RM-3B zones</a> and soon after started downzoning RM-3A areas to <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/4996.PDF">RM-3A1 or RM-3B</a> while at the same time <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/5015.PDF">continuing to downzone remaining RM-3 areas to RM-3A</a>. This process would take several years, catching up to our Alma corridor by December 1977 <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/5128.PDF">when it received its further downzone from RM-3A to RM-3B</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em> would continue to tinker with the RM codes, for instance adding and <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/5954.PDF">subtracting</a> discretionary FSR for units earmarked for seniors, until our Alma corridor was transformed into <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/6286.PDF">RM-3A1 in January 1988</a>, before the whole zone was <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/6330.PDF">renamed as RM-4 in April 1988</a>. This coincided with the expansion of the zone into former RS lots under Gordon Campbell’s somewhat more developer friendly NPA administration, and a couple of low-rise condo developments were added along Highbury. This is where the RM lots show up in our 1990 map, and where they’ve remained basically through the present (The original RM-4 zoning, which covered the West End before it was replaced by RM-4A and then WED zoning, <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/5840.PDF">had been phased out in October 1984</a>, and eventually the West End got downzoned to RM-5.) Meanwhile, the C-2 lands were increasingly allowed, at planner discretion, to accommodate residential apartments, as occurred for the lot on the NE corner of 5th &amp; Highbury. Finally, a CD comprehensive development spot rezoning was introduced at the NW corner of Alma &amp; Broadway in 2020, setting up our second development.</p>
<p>We can see the result today in this 3D view of the two sites we are interested in and the surrounding buildings.</p>

<p>The buildings are coloured by the period when they were built. Only one, in green, survives from the <em>Permissive Regime</em>. Here we divide up our <em>Zoning for Growth Regime</em> into pre-1961 and post-1961, reflecting our interest in the response to the 1961 upzoning. A number of smaller buildings and single family homes survive from before 1961, coloured in orange. Many more were produced after the upzoning, including towers laid out in purple. But not everything in RM came up towers during the 1961-1972 era; notice the multiple low-rise buildings along our strip. Nevertheless, nothing in RM was built to the tower form after the 1972 downzone. Indeed, not much got built at all for quite a while, with a flurry of buildings getting added between 1988 and 1990, including the new low-rise in lands rezoned from RS to RM and the C-2 zoned Jericho Centre and neighbouring condo building (which also benefited from a density transfer).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-tale-of-two-towers">A Tale of two Towers</h2>
<p>So let’s compare our two focus tower developments, the 1970 12-storey rental apartment on 7th and Alma and the currently under construction 14 storey MIRHPP at Broadway and Alma!</p>
<section id="w-7th-avenue" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="w-7th-avenue">3707 W 7th Avenue</h3>
<p>Here we have a 12 storey purpose-built rental apartment building, including some 86 apartments. This is just the kind of building that our MHRIPP policy is now meant to promote, constructed some fifty years ago. Of note, even then it could have been constructed as a condo building, though BC’s Strata Act was still relatively new at the time. We don’t know how long it took to pull together the financing for this building, but we do know that it was allowed as an outright use within the zoning code, requiring relatively little in the way of paperwork or discretionary review.</p>
<p>So how long did it take to build? <img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/images/alma-broadway-ad-oct-1970.png" alt="Alma/Broadway area" style="float:left;width:150px;padding-right:10px;">The city archives date the building permit for it to October 1969 for 86 units, with permit value of $635k. The building completed only about one year later, around which time it got advertised in the newspapers, as in this excerpt from the Vancouver Sun from October 1970. In sum, the timing between the start of our paper record and building completion extends to only a single year.</p>
<p>To understand how the zoning enabled (and forced) the form of this 12 storey building, we can take a look at the parcel and building footprint. <img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/index_files/figure-html/rental_1970_schematics-1.png" width="300" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;"></p>
<p>The building had a site coverage of 16%, which gave it a density bonus of 0.51 FSR. The site area bonus fetched the maximum allowed 0.25 FSR, and additionally there was an FSR bonus of up to 0.2 for the share of parking that is directly under the building footprint, for a total of between 1.76 and 1.96 FSR, depending on how parking is configured. The total gross FSR for the 12 storey building, estimated from LIDAR data, is approximately 1.88 which falls right into that outright allowed range.</p>
<p>By contrast, as the area got downzoned, our example building became impossible to rebuild. The reduction of height made the FSR bonusing challenging, and building nearly any kind of apartment building came to rely upon the discretion of the Planning Board. Apartments had to spread out, reducing our lot coverage bonus, and limiting the maximum achievable density on the site to 1.6 FSR.</p>
<p>Looking at lots nearby, low-rises later constructed within the downzoned RM-4 contained less floor space relative to lot size and significantly fewer apartments. And apartments in the area did not get cheaper. At the time we write this, a 635 sqft 1 BR apartment at 3707 w. 7th is currently on offer at a rent of <a href="https://vancouver.craigslist.org/van/apa/d/vancouver-bedroom-in-beautiful-point/7576927777.html">$2,575/mo</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of secured rental apartments in Vancouver is precisely what the <a href="(https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/08/12/mirhpp-tradeoffs/)">MIRHPP policy</a> was meant to address. So let’s take a look at how that’s going!</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="under-construction-at-alma-and-broadway" class="level1">
<h1>Under Construction at Alma and Broadway</h1>
<p>Everyone heading from west along the Broadway Corridor is familiar with the short hitch in their path at Alma as they scoot over to 10th to continue their journey to UBC. In 2022, a construction crane was added as a new landmark at the hitch, marking the intersection of Alma &amp; Broadway as the site of our MIRHPP project. As we write this we’re just beginning to see reinforced concrete peeking up above the excavation work.</p>
<p>Prior to demolition, the corner lot for our development held a small Commercially zoned strip mall, similar to the one nearby on the SE corner of 12th &amp; Alma. Its most notable tenant was probably True Confections dessert restaurant, which moved down the street to Broadway &amp; Collingwood in 2020. The lot, assembled together with a neighbouring house, had been <a href="https://claridgeadvisors.com/industry-insight/rezoning-application-3701-3743-west-broadway-vancouver/">purchased by developer Westbank in 2011</a> for about 9.4 million dollars.</p>
<p>Why did the site take so long to redevelop? We don’t know the whole story, but we suspect Westbank spent a fair amount of time reading the tea leaves of City Hall (as we discuss more below) and we also know that low-rise commercial often remains resilient to redevelopment in part because landlords are happy to continue raking in the rents while they decide what to do (the site’s rents were estimated at <a href="https://www.seevirtual360.com/featuresheet/23979-d125c263.pdf">$110,000 a year in 2011</a>, even with one storefront untenanted, while commercial tenants often pay property taxes). From here on out we’ll focus on when we know development plans began to advance, at which point we acquire a lengthy regulatory record based in rezoning, development permitting, and building permitting.</p>
<section id="rezoning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rezoning">Rezoning</h3>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/images/broadway_alma_initial_proposal.png" style="float:right;width:500px;max-width:50%;padding-left:10px;"></p>
<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405083631/https://rezoning.vancouver.ca/applications/3701-3743wbroadway/index.htm">initial rezoning application came in in December 2016</a> with open house in April 2017 to develop six-storey mixed-use structure with 94 rental apartments, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911202520/http://rezoning.vancouver.ca/applications/3701-3743wbroadway/documents/3701-3743WBroadway-ApplicantsOHboards-2017-04-05.pdf">built in a way so that another 6 storeys could be added at some later point in time</a>. Adding floors to an existing building is such a great way to add housing that Germans <a href="https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Aufstockung">invented a whole new word for it</a>. But typically new floors are added decades or even centuries after a building was built, when the urban environment changes and the complex work to add floors to an existing building becomes economically viable. In this case the final 12 storey building was already economically viable, but politically it was dead in the water. Therefore the developer opted for the more costly two-phase approach, building a six-storey building immediately, but designing it in a way so that another 6 storeys could be added later if and when the political climate shifted.</p>
<p>That political shift came faster than anticipated! The project was <a href="https://cityduo.wordpress.com/2019/05/08/the-wait-is-almost-over-moderate-income-rental-housing-finally-comes-to-west-point-grey/#more-2048">put on hold after the open house in 2017</a>. Taking advantage of the new <a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/mirhpp-public-faqs.pdf">MIRHPP policy</a> (approved by City Council in November 2017 and taking applications beginning in January 2018), the developer returned on November 15th, 2019 <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/8849/20211021195755/https://rezoning.vancouver.ca/applications/3701-3743wbroadway/index.htm">applying for a rezoning</a> of the existing C-2 strip mall and adjacent vacant RS-1 lot to build a 14 storey rental building with 20% of the units below market in perpetuity. The City scheduled another open house for February 13th, 2020. With only minor interruptions due to the pandemic, the process continued on, with <a href="https://claridgeadvisors.com/industry-insight/rezoning-application-3701-3743-west-broadway-vancouver/">changes to the proposal</a> made in response to the open house by May 2020. An on-line public hearing for the rezoning was scheduled for October 27th, 2020, but took two extra days because of the long list of speakers, <a href="https://cityduo.wordpress.com/2020/10/27/october-27th-2020-public-hearing-letters-flood-city-hall-as-economic-terror-threatens-mount-pleasant-while-middle-class-rental-homes-panic-west-point-grey/">many vehemently opposed</a> (by contrast, the owner of True Confections <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/3701-3743-west-broadway-vancouver-city-council-approved">spoke in favour</a>). The rezoning passed on October 29th, 2020, including 153 secured rental apartments (20% rented below market at rates well below those on offer at 3707 W. 7th). Notably the rezoning was approved under a different council than passed the MIRHPP policy, with an uncertain-seeming, but ultimately decisive <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/3701-3743-west-broadway-vancouver-city-council-approved">7-3 margin</a>. Overall it took almost a year to get site-specific zoning in place closely tailored to the proposed building parameters, not counting the multiple years of planning and time to do the initial design work and negotiate with staff through the pre-app phase.</p>
</section>
<section id="development-permit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="development-permit">Development Permit</h3>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/images/broadway_alma_rendering.jpeg" style="width:250px;max-width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"> However, the rezoning does not allow the proposed building to go forward outright, the zoning is only “conditional”. It still requires a discretionary Development Permit, which comes with another round of more detailed renderings, public feedback and, if things go well, staff approval. The City <a href="https://www.shapeyourcity.ca/3701-w-broadway">received the Development Permit application on December 16 2020</a>, with a public comment phase between February 2nd to February 26th 2021. The development permit board approved the (slightly modified) project on May 17th, 2021. The actual Development Permit was not issued until March 1st, 2022, a little over two years after the final rezoning application was submitted and following the excavation and shoring up of the site.</p>
</section>
<section id="building-permit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-permit">Building Permit</h3>
<p>The Building Permit is what’s needed to ensure that the building conforms to all the building codes, making it safe to live in and conforming with all the other requirements the City places on new buildings.</p>
<p>In Spring 2021, compliance with the zoning wasn’t fully in place yet with the development permit still outstanding, but the developer submitted permit applications for salvage and abatement as well as for demolition on April 4th, 2021 to clear the site of the existing strip mall. The developer applied for the Stage 1 Building Permit for excavation and shoring up on May 14th, just before the Development Permit Board hearing. The salvage and abatement permit came through on July 7th, 2021, and the demolition permit and building permit followed on August 24th and September 29th, respectively, taking the City 138 days each to process. At that point, the construction crews could finally get to work.</p>
</section>
<section id="construction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>We are not sure precisely when demolition or construction for this site started, but it took some time to excavate and shore up the site. The digging was well underway by Spring 2022.</p>
<p>While digging the developer would have applied for Stage 2 of the building permit to get permissions for foundation and building up to grade, which would have been granted sometime after the Development Permit was granted on March 1st 2022. As construction below ground progresses the developer would have applied for Stage 3 of the Building Permit for full construction. Unfortunately the City Open Data permit data does not track the different stages of the Building Permit, so we can’t reconstruct the exact timelines of these. But the crane was installed in June of 2022.</p>
<p>The next data point we have is a building “start” from CMHC for 164 rental apartment units in September 2022 in the census tract for the site, exactly matching the count of rental units from the DP application. At this point parts of the construction are still just now peeking up from below ground level. <a href="https://westbankcorp.com/body-of-work/broadway-and-alma">Westbank</a> still projects a completion date of “2023” but this seems… ambitious. Regardless, it will still take some time before these units “complete” in CMHC data and begin to welcome new residents.</p>
<p>Overall, the lengthy timeline of the Broadway/Alma project speaks to how developers may try to reduce risk by buying land proactively well in advance of when they intend to develop it, waiting for the right timing to develop. Similarly, developers might start rezoning and permitting processes prematurely, abandoning or renegotiating as conditions change. Of course only well-capitalized developers have the resources to do this. This behaviour, incentivized by the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em>, is sometimes called <em>land banking</em> or <em>permit banking</em>. But the focus should probably turn from developers here, to where their attention has been rationally redirected by the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em>: the politics and policies of City Hall. In many respects, the practices of the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em> effectively prevent land from being developed until the diverse and changeable priorities of City Hall align with the generally more constant priorities of developers.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-point-grey-neighbourhood" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-point-grey-neighbourhood">The Point Grey neighbourhood</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look more broadly how this has played out in the Point Grey neighbourhood, where the Alma/Broadway project, as well as the apartment building from 1970 pictured above, are located. Here is how this neighbourhood is defined in CMHC data.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/index_files/figure-html/point_grey_hood-1.png" width="1050"></p>
<p>How many condo or rental apartments have been built in that area? CMHC data at the neighbourhood level goes back to 2010.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2023-02-06-a-brief-history-of-vancouver-planning-development-regimes/index_files/figure-html/point_grey_apartment_starts-1.png" width="1050"></p>
<p>And as one might have expected, very few apartments have been built. A recent low-rise mixed-use commercial (C-2 zoning) with 36 apartments over top shows up as a 2010 start (completed in 2012 near Discovery &amp; 10th). Some of the rest of the low level noise is due to secondary suites, which CMHC data counts as single rental apartment units. The apartment ban gradually installed through the transition from the <em>Zoning for Growth</em> to the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em> has been very effective in Point Grey. As a result, the Broadway/Alma project registering as a 2022 start really stands out.</p>
<p>As for that Broadway/Alma project, it’s worth remembering that in the near future it should be sitting practically on top of a <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/ubc-skytrain-extension-route-update-translink">new SkyTrain Station</a>, and just to the East of the soon-to-be-booming <a href="https://www.shapeyourcity.ca/jericho-lands">Jericho Lands</a>. Point Grey is about to change. But it remains to be seen how fast. The clock has already started.</p>
</section>
<section id="takeaway" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>From 1970 to 2022 we shifted between two different planning and development regimes. The <strong>Zoning for Growth Regime</strong> definitely had its problems, but if it allowed you to build something, you knew you could build it, and you could build it quick. The zoning change in 1961 enabled and encouraged towers, and as far as we can tell, the developer of 3707 W. 7th needed only their building permit issued in 1969 to construct their 12-storey tower by 1970. Shortly thereafter we shifted into our current <strong>Spot Discretionary Regime</strong>. Here the developer purchased the assembled lot in 2011, began wading through political currents of rezoning in December 2016, only to dive in fully after policies shifted with a rezoning application in November 2019, approved in October 2020, with development permit and building permit processes holding up excavation till Spring of 2022. It won’t be done till the end of 2023 at the absolute earliest, some 4-12 years after the process began, depending upon when one starts the clock.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Zoning for Growth Regime</strong> developers were able to be responsive to changes in prices and add housing fast, purchasing development sites with full understanding what could be built and only needing a building permit. This reflects what economists call “supply elasticity,” or the ability for markets to serve as a mechanism linking increases or decreases in construction activity to increases or decreases in demand as expressed through changes in prices or rents. So long as outright zoning contained ample capacity to accommodate growth, generally reflected in upzoning in Vancouver until 1972, housing supply generally responded to housing demand.</p>
<p>The <strong>Spot Discretionary Regime</strong> directly targeted the market mechanisms enabling additional housing to be added in response to demand. The added uncertainty introduced by new discretionary processes required developers to speculate on what could be built when buying lots, adding risk. This process selected for developers well connected with City Hall and acquiring a deep understanding of the inner workings of the planning department. It also selected for developers who were well-capitalized to be able to handle the additional risk. The substantial lengthening of permitting times made an effective market response to changing prices next to impossible. Given 4+ years of process, the market at the time a new housing project completes could be quite different from the market when the housing project began.</p>
<p>This is not to say that market mechanisms are all that we should pay attention to, but they’re certainly key to getting more market affordability and evidence strongly suggests the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em> works no better in getting non-market housing built. This is also not to say that market mechanisms have disappeared. Indeed, they still work during downturns, when (well-capitalized) developers can abandon or delay projects working their way through the approvals timeline as economic conditions become less favourable. In effect, the <em>Spot Discretionary Regime</em> has broken broken supply elasticity and replaced it with a ratchet. On upswings, planners limit how much housing developers can initiate and on downswings developers withdraw from projects that look like losers. The end result: supply hardly ever catches up to demand. And housing keeps getting more expensive.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/12/17/analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>So we recently had an election in the City of Vancouver. Citizens elected a new mayor, ten council members, park board and school board, giving a majority to the centre-right leaning new <a href="https://abcvancouver.ca/">ABC (A Better City)</a> Party candidates for each (<a href="https://results.vancouver.ca/results.html?utm_campaign=election-results&amp;utm_medium=Vanity&amp;utm_source=election-results_Vanity#redirect">full results</a> posted by the City). There are a variety of narratives out there about how it all went down. Here we’re interested in examining a couple of them in further detail using the recently released individual ballot data (all ballots remain anonymous, of course). Of note, the mayoral vote is straight-forward, each voter got to vote for one mayoral candidate. The council votes are more interesting. There voters could choose up to 10 candidates. For this post we will focus on council votes, but we’ll return to examining how they relate to mayoral votes.</p>
<p>In terms of relevant narratives about the election, two stand out as worth examining with ballot data: the election came down to organizing and/or the election came down to positioning.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk organizing. Here we can start with it’s relative absence in binding together the diverse parties occupying the centre-left. Left-leaning parties, including Forward Vancouver, OneCity, COPE, and the Greens, arguably competed at least as much with each other as they did with the centre-right. No single party has dominated since the collapse of the centre-left Vision party in 2018. That collapse, though largely driven by internal dynamics, was hastened by the Vancouver District Labour Council (VDLC) eschewing Vision in favour of attempting to organize a slate from the other three centre-left parties. In effect the VDLC brokered the number of candidates from each party they would support, and most parties kept to the bargain. The slate was somewhat successful in 2018, electing three Greens, one OneCity, and one COPE councillor together with the VDLC’s chosen independent mayoral candidate. The VDLC attempted the trick again this year, but only OneCity limited themselves to the number of candidates chosen for them, and new parties entered the field altogether running entirely too many candidates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the historical centre-right party, the Non-Partisan Association (NPA), also seemed on the verge of collapse after 2018. And collapse it did, after a takeover by far-right party activists drove out four out of its five sitting councillors. One started a new party (TEAM), largely devoted to opposing development and SkyTrain expansion, and ran as its mayoral candidate. The other three joined up with the NPA’s former mayoral candidate, who very narrowly lost in 2018, to start an entirely new party, staking a strong claim - with a lot of money behind it - to a generally pro-development and socially liberal centre-right. So there’s a rough re-cap. But just how did this give ABC an organizational advantage?</p>
<p>First off, ABC faced no constraints placed upon the size of their slate. So they were able to run with seven candidates: enough to hold a majority on council, without so many that votes were likely to be diluted. Arguably, seven candidates was the perfect size for “[vote plumping](https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/opinion/editorial-to-plump-or-not-to-plump-your-vote/#” within a council of ten. True party supporters could vote for all of their candidates and no one else’s, avoiding lending support to any other parties and correspondingly boosting the weight of their favoured party. Not coincidentally, this was also the number of candidates Vision generally ran with during the height of its power.</p>
<p>Did voters really follow this strategy? To start out we take a look at the distribution of the number of votes cast on council ballots.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/ballot-vote-count-1.png" width="900"></p>
<p>As one would expect, the most popular choice was to vote for 10 candidates, but just over half of the voters voted for fewer than 10 candidates. What’s curious is that the second most popular option was people voting for 7 candidates.</p>
<p>Interesting! Let’s follow-up by checking how many ballots were straight-party tickets with nobody else on the ballot? So these are ballots with fewer than the maximum of 10 votes where some votes were intentionally wasted, “plumping” up the relative power of the votes that remained.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/slate-pure-1.png" width="900"></p>
<p>We see that in particular ABC voters made use of this strategy, relating back to the top where we saw a high number of people casting exactly seven votes. The majority of these were pure ABC slate ballots. TEAM voters, looking at a similarly sized slate, also made use of this strategy, there just weren’t nearly enough of them to matter. TEAM’s poor showing emphasizes a lesson worth teaching over and over again: despite what we see at public hearings on rezoning applications, anti-housing politics might be well-organized, but they really aren’t very popular.</p>
<p>Now let’s shift our analysis slightly. Let’s look at ballots where a full party slate got voted in, but also contains some other votes. These are full party-line ballots, but not plumped by strategic avoidance of voting for anyone outside the party.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/slate-mixed-1.png" width="900"></p>
<p>ABC still shows strongly with 25% of voters voting for all seven ABC council candidates. Given that the lowest vote share of all elected councillors was lower at 18%, just these party slate ballots were enough to guarantee all seven ABC got elected. But we also see some of the smaller Left of Centre parties emerging. In particular, OneCity partisans really, really liked all four of the OneCity candidates. They just also voted for a bunch of other candidates to fill out their rosters, perhaps inadvertently reducing the overall effect of their support. (Vote Socialist also had a strong showing, but they only had a single candidate running for Council).</p>
<p>Of note, this graph also counts some ballots twice. For example it is possible to vote the entire Forward and OneCity slates on a single ballot, voting for all six Forward and all four OneCity candidates. This is one way to add up a full slate. Looking at the ballots, 2,269 people did exactly this, demonstrating some affinity between these parties.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some other ways to demonstrate affinities. Now we’re shifting from sheer organizational advantages as determinants of election outcomes to thinking more about how issues and positioning might’ve tied different parties together or left them competing with one another.</p>
<section id="correlation-and-voting-blocks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlation-and-voting-blocks">Correlation and voting blocks</h2>
<p>A simple way to try and understand voting patterns on council votes is to look at how votes for different candidates on each ballot correlated.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/council-coorelations-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>To keep things manageable we weaned down the list of 59 council candidates to the top 30 vote-getters, ordered by party and number of votes the candidates got. In the correlation plot we can immediately identify major parties, visible as blocks with high cross-correlation around the diagonal. Parties really work as organizers for voters in Vancouver’s at-large council elections (as opposed to the ward systems common across other big Canadian cities).</p>
<p>The first block, picking up ABC support, shows the strongest cross-correlation with fairly strong negative correlation with all other candidates except the lone NPA candidate that made the top 30 (and remember that ABC split off from the increasing dysfunction of the NPA). This indicates high party discipline for ABC voters, despite some residual brand loyalty to the NPA, and possibly some bleed over for the noted police affiliations of both parties.</p>
<p>The next four party blocks cover the GREENs, OneCity, Forward, and COPE, with weakly positive or neutral correlations to each other. The strongest connections can be found between OneCity and Forward, OneCity and COPE (OneCity first <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/courier-archive/news/lone-candidate-hopes-for-onecity-direction-2977588">split from COPE</a> in the 2014 election), and GREEN and COPE, suggesting some lingering divisions over the notable <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2018/10/22/urbanism-axis-imby-allies/">urbanism axis</a> in left-wing Vancouver politics.</p>
<p>The next block is the single remaining incumbent NPA candidate, and the only one to make it into the top 30, showing weak but positive correlations with ABC.</p>
<p>Last in our top 30 candidates comes the TEAM block, who attempted to split off from the NPA by gathering all its NIMBY-est voters together with a who’s who of Vancouver’s assorted <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/neighborhood-defenders/0677F4F75667B490CBC7A98396DD527A">Neighbourhood Defenders</a>. They exhibit neutral or weak anticorrelation with everyone else.</p>
</section>
<section id="clusters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clusters">Clusters</h2>
<p>Taking a slightly different tack to tracking how voters related parties to one another, we can run a cluster analysis on the individual ballot data. To keep things manageable we are only showing the results for the top 30 candidates. Given the ballot data, 5 clusters seems like a good choice that captures most of the variation in votes.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/cluster-graph-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The results give a way to sumamrize voting behaviour. The first cluster, ordered by number of ballots in that cluster, is the ABC cluster. We see very high voting discipline, with some additional votes for Melissa De Genova, suggesting that there was a strong voter movement from the NPA.</p>
<p>The second cluster is quite scattered in their voting, demonstrating little in the way of party discipline. Many of these votes might simply reflect incumbency, with the strong showing by Forward Vancouver (a new party) gauging support for the mayor. But while Forward received the highest frequency of votes in this cluster, it’s definitely not JUST or even PRIMARILY a “Forward” cluster. Indeed, other clusters have higher frequency of votes for Forward candidates, but in those Forward appears to be a second or third choice, rather than the first. While Forward arguably ran with the right number of candidates (six), the data demonstrate the difficulty of organizing a party at the last possible minute. We see little evidence of anything approaching Forward party discipline, and the party ultimately failed to get any councillors elected (though they came very close to getting Dulcy Anderson over the line!)</p>
<p>The third cluster stands out as the most strongly left-of-centre cluster, and it’s clearly led by the party discipline of OneCity. But with only four candidates, OneCity voters spread their remaining six votes out across a real mix of Forward, COPE, and the GREENs. It wasn’t quite enough to see most OneCity’s new candidates elected, though they returned their incumbent, Christine Boyle, in part on the strength of her support in the next cluser, led by the GREENs.</p>
<p>The fourth candidate is the GREEN cluster. What can you say? The GREENs still have a viable party, but their supporters (and to some extent their councillors) remain all over the map. They liked Jean Swanson’s populist antics on council, but it wasn’t enough to return her to chambers, and the same went for the Forward slate, which had relatively broad low-level support from GREEN voters, but not enough. By contrast, GREEN voters also liked Christine Boyle from OneCity well enough for her to comfortably return. And GREEN voters also voted in a striking number of ABC councillors, and even a few TEAMsters. As a result, it’s still not quite clear what GREEN voters want, unless you count the vaguely positive connotations of colour branding.</p>
<p>The last cluster is the TEAM cluster, with high voting discipline and a little bit of pull on ABC and GREEN candidates. But TEAM had a very weak showing in the other clusters. As a result, even a strong showing in the cluster with the lowest number of ballots was nowhere near enough to get candidates elected. Running against new housing and SkyTrain expansion is just not popular. Who knew? (<a href="https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/majority-favours-more-housing-options-and-increased-density-across-vancouver.aspx">Who</a> <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/metro-vancouver-skytrain-expansion-survey">indeed</a>?)</p>
<p>Let’s return to the influence of the VDLC. How did the <a href="https://vdlc.ca/vdlc-endorses-municipal-candidates/">Vancouver District Labout Council election endorsements</a> matter? They endorsed 10 candidates in 2022, three of whom got elected. Only 1,321 voters chose the full VDLC slate on their ballots. But let’s take a broader look at their impact on voters. What share of voters voted for any number of VDLC endorsed candidates?</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/vdlc-ballot-share-1.png" width="900"></p>
<p>While a little over half of all voters voted for at least one VDLC candidate, the minimum number of votes VDLC candidates got on each ballot drops off fast as we approach the full slate. We can visualize voter discipline by looking just at the correlation plot of VDLC candidates.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/vdlc_correlations-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>As can be expected this shows that party affiliation had much stronger cohesion than VDLC, but what’s concerning is how little cross-correlation there is between VDLC candidates across party lines. The strongest correlation is between OneCity and Forward candidates, but as we observed before, this correlation was not restricted to VDLC candidates and it is difficult to argue that VDLC strengthened it much. Jean Swanson stands out as having positive correlations to everyone else, with the weakest correlation to Forward candidates.</p>
</section>
<section id="mayoral-pull" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mayoral-pull">Mayoral pull</h2>
<p>One question we haven’t addressed yet is what kind of pull, if any, mayoral candidates had on the council ticket. First, let’s add up the mayoral votes corresponding to each council candidate’s support.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/council_by_mayoral_vote-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Once again we see how ABC really stuck together, with the vast majority of ABC council support accompanied by votes for new ABC mayor, Ken Sim, at the top of the ticket. Interestingly people voting for the NPA candidate Melissa de Genova also mostly voted for Ken Sim instead of the hapless NPA mayoral candidate, Fred Harding.</p>
<p>A similar but weaker pattern holds with Forward and TEAM candidates. When voters chose council candidates of one party, they also tended to choose the mayoral candidate of that party if one was available. Yet this was only narrowly the case for TEAM, with Colleen Hardwick often less popular than her council candidates. Interestingly, Stewart was the mayoral choice for nearly as many OneCity council voters as he was for those voting for his Forward Vancouver candidates. But GREEN party council voters wandered quite a bit more in terms of their preferred mayoral candidates.</p>
<p>Let’s reverse this figure and look at the spread of council votes by mayoral ballot.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/council_by_mayoral_vote2-1.png" width="1050"></p>
<p>Once again, here we see that Ken Sim had a strong pull on the council ballot, with voters for Ken Sim overwhelmingly voting for ABC candidates, and often only ABC candidates. By contrast, Kennedy Stewart support was built up from supporters of a diverse array of left-of-centre parties, but especially Forward, OneCity, and COPE, with the GREENs most likely to spread their love around.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s take a look at how mayors did at carrying along their slates. While Ken Sim ran with a slate of seven, Kennedy Stewart eventually pulled together a slate of six for Forward Vancouver, and TEAM (Hardwick) and Progress (Marissen) ran at the same size. How many candidates from mayoral party slates got left off the ballot when voters chose a mayor? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-12-17-analyzing-ballot-composition-in-vancouver/index_files/figure-html/council_by_mayoral_vote3-1.png" width="1050"></p>
<p>Again, we see that almost half of the people voting for Ken Sim for mayor also voted for the full slate of ABC party candidates. In this case, we further evidence of disciplined party voters. Colleen Hardwick’s voters look similarly disciplined, though it’s worth noting once again that she frequently underperformed her council candidates. Kennedy Stewart performed worst by this metric of party discipline, but he also had the most hastily assembled set of council candidates. On the flip side, urbanist Mark Marissen had the highest share of ballots that picked him for mayor but voted for absolutely none of his party candidates.</p>
</section>
<section id="takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Narratives will continue to spin concerning the outcome of the 2022 election in Vancouver and we can’t put them all to rest. But a few clear takeaways emerge from our examination of the ballots.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ABC had the most disciplined voters lined up for the most organized roster of candidates.</li>
<li>voters on the Centre-Left remained mostly undisciplined with no clear central organizing roster</li>
<li>OneCity voters and roster appeared the most disciplined &amp; organized within the centre-left</li>
<li>GREEN voters still look kind of flaky</li>
<li>TEAM voters were relatively disciplined, but they’re just not very popular</li>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/11/24/new-premier-new-housing-policy/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>In this post, we take a moment to appreciate the first housing policy announcements from BC’s new Premier, offered up just days into his term. David Eby comes to the post fresh from his joint roles as Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing. In these roles, he was central to fashioning the teeth behind BC’s housing policy. Initially these teeth were directed at the private sector, with a special focus on rooting out the “toxic demand” thought to be leaving too many dwellings empty. The Speculation and Vacancy Tax (SVT) remains the most visible legacy of this approach, as we’ve <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/11/22/three-years-of-speculation-and-vacancy-tax-data/">written about before</a> and we provide a brief update of SVT results based upon the latest release in our appendix below. But other legacies include things like BC’s <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/real-estate-bc/land-owner-transparency-registry">beneficial ownership registry</a>, insuring better transparency for private corporations.</p>
<p>It hasn’t all been teeth, though. Under the NDP, BC has also invested more heavily in social and affordable housing, with the party more than <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/organizational-structure/crown-corporations/ey-report-bc-housing.pdf#page=3">doubling the budget</a> of BC Housing as public agency since taking over in 2017. These investments in social and affordable housing have directly contributed to improving peoples’ lives and we’d join those arguing <a href="https://vancouversun.com/opinion/iglika-ivanova-and-alex-hemingway-soaring-cost-of-living-highlights-urgent-need-to-tackle-housing-affordability">that we’re still not building enough</a>. But even here, the teeth came out when it came to the corporate side, largely directed at BC Housing’s operation as a Crown Corporation, as in this past July’s <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022AG0109-001091">snap announcement that a new board would be taking over</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022PREM0065-001745">This week’s announcement</a> doubles down on teeth. But Eby’s found a new target in municipal and strata corporations (i.e.&nbsp;condominium).</p>
<p>These two kinds of corporations are, in many respects, more similar than not. Both afford expansive local powers over land, development, property use, and servicing. Both are established via legislation as “creatures of provincial governments” (as Eby argued directly in a recent case in <a href="https://thetyee.ca/News/2021/03/09/David-Eby-Defends-Decision-Back-Doug-Ford/">otherwise unlikely support of Doug Ford’s powers</a> in Ontario). But strata corporations are generally nested within municipal corporations, and a key difference between the two has been in governance structure and exclusions carved out from Human Rights Codes. In particular, renters don’t get to vote in strata, unlike in municipalities. Renters could also be excluded by strata corporations entirely (via rental restriction bylaws). And strata could also put in place age restrictions on residents (unlike cities). As for municipal corporations, their means of exclusion remain more limited than strata corporations, though the scale of their exclusion has wider reach. Municipalities exclude mostly by preventing new housing from being built.</p>
<p>And here’s where the teeth come in. New amendments to the Strata Act rip away existing strata corporation rights to exclude renters and discriminate by age (excepting for explicit retirement communities). Separately, the province is nipping away at municipal corporations’ independence in precisely those places where it’s being used to deny housing.</p>
<p>So can teeth grow housing?</p>
<p>We’re pretty sure that the answer is YES!</p>
<p>But it takes care and skill, because teeth only work to grow housing if they’re deployed against the right targets with the right pressure. Think of a well trained sheepdog nipping its flock into shape. Let’s take a closer look at what the new announcements portend in this regard, splitting out the strata corporation and municipal corporation parts separately.</p>
<section id="strata-rental-restrictions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strata-rental-restrictions">Strata rental restrictions</h2>
<p>Removing the option for rental restrictions from strata legislation is not aimed at growing new housing so much as adding currently (mostly) empty housing back to the market for habitation. In this way it’s most similar to the Speculation and Vacancy Tax, which aimed at the same target. Of note: rental restriction exemptions from the SVT also no longer apply as of 2022. This raises three questions.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>How many properties are affected by this legislative change?</li>
<li>How many properties can we expect to get added to the occupied housing stock?</li>
<li>Would these properties have ended up there anyway?</li>
</ol>
<p>In answer to the first question, the premier cited a number of 300k strata units with rental restrictions that this law could apply to, but this is likely a substantial over-estimate. It appears that this is simply the number of strata units with plans registered before January 1st 2010. That’s when the law changed so developers could exempt new strata from rental restrictions over the long term regardless of whether strata councils attempted to pass such restrictions. Many developers did so, reducing the prevalence of rental restrictions past this point, but not (contra the impression from the provincial press conference), banning such restrictions. On the flipside, there are also many older strata corporations that don’t have rental restrictions, and for those that do there are a broad range of models for how they apply and how binding they are. Some strata corporations ban all rentals, others allow only a limited number or share of properties to be rented out, some allow up to half of strata lots being rented. The legislation will impact strata corporations with different types of rental restrictions to a different degree.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to give a precise answer to the first question. But the second one might be a bit easier.</p>
<p>At least for the regions covered by the SVT we know how many strata units have been claiming the exemption from the tax due to strata rental restrictions, giving a proxy estimate of how many units are being held off the market because of these rules. It’s only a proxy insofar as claimed exemptions don’t necessarily reflect the underlying logic or situations of landlords; often it just comes down to which exemption is easiest to claim. In the <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022PREM0065-001745">press release and conference</a> the premier noted that approximately 2,900 strata units claimed the rental restriction exemption in the SVT regions in 2021, the last year in which it was available. This appears to roughly match SVT technical report counts, except that there exemptions are reported in terms of the number of owners claiming the exemption rather than properties. Latest revised counts for 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 came in at <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/SVT_Annual_Mayors_Consultation_Technical_Briefing_2020.pdf#page=13">5,591, 5,194,</a> <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/SVT_technical_briefing_2021_tax_year.pdf#page=11">4,661, and 4.081 owners, respectively</a>, showing a gradual decline in those taking the rental restriction exemption since the SVT began. It’s quite reasonable that the most recent figure equates to 2,900 strata units, as reported by Eby, if enough owners laid claim to the same properties.</p>
<p>Drawing upon the <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/SVT_technical_briefing_2021_tax_year.pdf#page=11">latest report</a> (just released after Eby’s press conference!) we can also check how rental restriction exemptions have been distributed spatially. Again, we draw upon owners claiming rental restrictions rather than strata units.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-11-24-new-premier-new-housing-policy/index_files/figure-html/rental-exemptions-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Here we see most reporting municipalities have already witnessed a decline in units claiming the rental restriction exemption. But this data only covers the SVT regions. Of course, this is also where most strata condominium properties are located. We can use 2021 census data to estimate that roughly 87% of BC condo units are in the SVT area. It would be better to use BC Assessment data for estimates like this, but unfortunately our province keeps BC housing data locked up in order to be able to sell it (we’ll return to our pitch for more open data below). Overall we would expect somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 rental units might get freed up were rental restricted units returned to the market. Probably closer to 3,000. That’s equivalent to a one-time supply shock of less than 10% of annual completions. Not nothing, and every bit helps, but on it’s own this will do little to get us to where we need to be with CMHC analysis suggesting we need to more than double housing completions over the next ten years to catch up on our housing deficit.</p>
<p>But were changes to the Strata Act necessary to bring these units back to the market, or would they have gone there anyway given the removal of the rental restriction exemption to the SVT in effect as of this year? This remains a good question. Certainly the removal of the rental restriction exemption within the SVT and the removal of strata rights to restrict rents can be expected to work together more smoothly now. Applying teeth to strata complement the teeth already applied to property owners, providing the latter with new options to rent out their units rather than paying the tax instead of just selling or moving in themselves. This makes sense from a policy perspective, lessening the impact of the SVT change on those most affected. But it’s hard to separate out how many units are likely to become newly occupied from the Strata Act change from how many units were already likely to shift into occupation due to the SVT change.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn’t do a lot for supply, lifting rental restrictions in strata can still help a lot of renters, especially those caught between strata rules and landlord attempts to evade them. This should lead to greater renter security and (hopefully) less renter stigma, and we applaud Eby for this move, bringing BC’s policies more in line with places like Australia’s, where rental restrictions have long been disallowed within strata (more on <a href="https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2018/12/Comparative-law-accompanying-document.pdf">comparative strata law here</a>). Yet renters in condominium are still likely to remain second class citizens. They still won’t get to vote or have much of a say within the “fourth level of government” administered by the strata corporation.</p>
</section>
<section id="age-restrictions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age-restrictions">Age restrictions</h2>
<p>The other part of the legislative changes addresses age restrictions. This probably won’t change the total number of units available, but it does address the question of how these units can be occupied. As our <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/facultyresearchandpublications/52383/items/1.0355741">past research demonstrates via audit study</a>, discrimination against children is a regular feature of the rental market. Mostly this is illegal, running against BC’s Human Rights Code. But as <a href="https://www.iculc2022.org/schedule-saturday-july-16th">Doug Harris explained in a recent talk</a>, BC is the only province in Canada enabling age restrictions in strata other than for senior housing, and there are questions around how this fits in with broader anti-discrimination rules in Canada. This was not addressed in the last overhaul of the condominium law which BC used to further clarify exactly how condo can discriminate against children and young adults, but it’s good to see the teeth of the province finally cutting away the ability for strata to engage in these discriminatory practices.</p>
</section>
<section id="nipping-municipalities-into-shape" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nipping-municipalities-into-shape">Nipping Municipalities into Shape</h2>
<p>What about municipalities? Here’s where we see the most potential for teeth to grow housing.</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://zoning.sociology.ubc.ca">work on metropolitan zoning practices</a> has amply demonstrated, municipalities have used the powers given to them by the province to tightly regulate the addition of new housing. Through rules attached to lots, municipalities narrowly circumscribe the locations in which new multi-unit housing can be added and <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2021/07/25/lots-of-opportunity-estimating-the-zoning-tax-in-vancouver/">prevent the subdivision of lots</a> enabling more single-family housing. As a result, in many of our municipalities it often takes years of negotiations and approval processes to add new housing. Overall this makes it more expensive to construct housing and reduces the amount that gets built. Moreover, <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/03/30/ubcm-shenanigans/">municipalities don’t seem to be fully aware</a> of their role in our provincial housing shortage.</p>
<p>As it stands, the province has not yet committed to reforming municipal powers. Instead in 2019 the province began requiring municipalities to author <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/policy-and-planning-tools-for-housing/housing-needs-reports">Housing Needs reports</a>, estimating how much new housing of what type was required to meet projected future needs. But the province did not require municipalities to adhere to common estimation standards or pre-zone for this new housing. Enter the newly announced “<a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022PREM0065-001745">Housing Supply Act</a>,” adding teeth to both Housing Needs reporting and its implications. Assuming it is enacted, the province will begin the process of auditing needs reports (choosing 8-10 recalcitrant municipalities) and working directly with municipal governments to insure the housing needed gets built, including by order-in-council, overriding municipal exclusion powers where necessary.</p>
<p>Is this all bark and no bite? So far, yes. BUT… there’s a promise of a bite to come, and that might be enough for a skilled sheepdog to bring our flock of wayward municipalities to order. In the short term, there’s a hope that municipalities will begin planning for and approving more housing so as to avoid making “the list” of 8-10 municipalities at risk of having their control over development stripped away by the province. No one wants to be the example made to others. We see this as all to the good.</p>
<p>In the long term, as the province chooses its examples it will become forced to work through its own definitions of how to understand housing need and translate that need into development objectives. This is going to be hard and risky work. Even by itself, estimating housing need is really hard, as <a href="https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/1594744139887030272">explained in a good piece in the Atlantic the other day</a>. We have explained the <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/04/26/planning-for-scarcity/">complications associated with modelling housing demand in detail before</a>, and highlighted how misspecifications of housing demand models by regional planners have systematically enabled the buildup of our housing shortage. We’ve also made a start at estimating aspects of housing need, like <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/06/estimating-suppressed-household-formation/">suppressed household formation</a>. CMHC has also done some work on this front by <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/research-reports/accelerate-supply/housing-shortages-canada-solving-affordability-crisis">providing estimates of the provincial supply gap and projecting what needs to be done to close our current gaps by 2030</a>. But housing is inherently local, and work is underway to provide metro level supply gap estimates.</p>
<p>The province has indicated that they are looking for municipal level targets as it is municipalities that engage in the rationing of housing. But the province has not explained how these municipal level targets are linked. Right now municipalities create housing needs reports in isolation, but that’s not how housing works. When only modelling individual municipalities, the province won’t be able to distinguish if e.g.&nbsp;housing demand in Lion’s Bay is high because people want to live in that location, or if that’s only the fallback choice because West Vancouver failed to build housing. Going either by <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/04/26/planning-for-scarcity/">methodology prescribed by the province for their current municipal housing needs reports</a>, or the <a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/here-s-how-b-c-s-new-premier-plans-to-tackle-the-affordable-housing-crisis-1.6162091">news reporting on the proposed evaluation of municipal targets</a> it looks like the province still has a ways to go in understanding how to model demand for housing. The current methodology does not adequately deal with suppressed household formation or changed in and out migration due to housing pressures, and they fail to recognize the role of rising incomes on housing consumption. As such they are bound to <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/04/26/planning-for-scarcity/">systematically under-estimate housing demand</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternatives-to-rationing-housing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alternatives-to-rationing-housing">Alternatives to rationing housing</h2>
<p>It’s important to note that the provincial approach is still grounded in our current planning regime built around rationing housing at the municipal level. Even the new provincial teeth are only nipping at the edges here, intervening via housing targets to prevent excessive rationing but not otherwise yet departing from the shape of existing practice. Policy is path-dependent, and given where we are this may be a defensible approach. But it’s worth pointing out alternative approaches. One approach would be to require municipalities to provide ample outright zoning to allow for organic housing growth. This could also be combined with overriding restrictive zoning, especially near central areas with provincially funded transit infrastructure. Effectively these kind of moves would follow the <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/06/22/the-other-down-under-grows-up-new-zealands-new-urban-development-policy/">New Zealand approach</a>, which is showing very encouraging first results both in terms of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2022/01/24/new-zealands-bipartisan-housing-reforms-offer-a-model-to-other-countries/">increase in housing production</a> as well as <a href="https://onefinaleffort.com/auckland">effects on rents</a>.</p>
<p>In his leadership race Eby did suggest to allow at a minimum for three (strata) units outright on every lot in “urban centres” in BC. There has been no policy brought forward to implement this (yet), but this would be a small step toward breaking out of the rationing regimen and allowing housing to grow via outright zoning. This <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2022/01/24/new-zealands-bipartisan-housing-reforms-offer-a-model-to-other-countries/">falls short of what New Zealand implemented</a> but does follow their direction.</p>
<p>In many urban municipalities enabling three units per lot outright would constitute a significant bump in allowable density, although cities could easily make it unviable through parking requirements or other zoning constraints. The City of Vancouver already technically allows three (or four) units per lot, but Eby’s proposal to allow strata dramatically changes how these properties could get used. To realize this density currently the City of Vancouver is asking an owner-investor family to take on a larger mortgage than what’s required for their family and also take on two rental properties on their lot and operate them as landlords. This incentivizes high debt levels and coerces people into becoming landlords. Over the years as the family pays down their mortgage and their income rises they often choose to stop renting out their suite, leading to <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2018/01/25/empty-suites/">suites being the most empty form of housing in Vancouver</a>. The proposal by Eby would change this by allowing to stratify the property, with the family buying as much housing as they need and taking on a lower mortgage instead of relying on a secondary suite or laneway house as a “mortgage helper”. After all, the best mortgage helper is a lower mortgage. Moreover, the other units would now be separate taxable dwelling units, and thus subject to other regulations like the Empty Homes Tax and the Speculation and Vacancy Tax, and there are currently a lot more unoccupied suites than there are strata properties that sit empty because of rental restrictions.</p>
<p>We hope the proposal on allowing 3 units outright will come, and that it gets expanded on. In central cities like Vancouver we have already been discussing <a href="https://www.makinghome.ca">allowing 6 units per lot</a>, with <a href="https://www.onecityvancouver.ca/the_homes_we_need">some parties campaigning on allowing lowrise apartments everywhere</a>, which is more in line with the demand for housing in amenity and jobs rich Vancouver. New Zealand and California have tied some of their rules to their frequent transit network, some years back we have looked at <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/02/21/planned-displacement/">where development within the frequent transit network should go if minimizing renter displacement were a policy objective (it should be!)</a>. Tackling BC’s housing shortage requires ambitious action. Our new Premier is off to a good start, but we hope he doesn’t stop now. And we’ll keep pointing toward New Zealand as a good place to go for policy innovation!</p>
</section>
<section id="less-toothy-housing-policy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="less-toothy-housing-policy">Less Toothy Housing Policy</h2>
<p>All and all, we’re happy to see our new premier adding more teeth to BC’s housing policies, especially insofar as those teeth keep nipping away at the exclusionary powers of strata corporations and municipal corporations. We’d also like more non-toothy policies, including the long promised Renter’s Rebate and more support for building out the non-profit sector (which may be coming). When asked <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/where-is-renters-rebate">Eby did indicate that he had not forgotten about the renter’s rebate</a>, but there is no timeline for when it will arrive. As a reminder, this was initially envisioned to <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/property-taxes/annual-property-tax/home-owner-grant">equalize the homeowner grant</a> that most homeowners enjoy, and provide a small step toward tenure neutrality and undoing the enormous imbalance in benefits higher levels of government bestow upon owners, most notably non-taxation of imputed rent and non-taxation of principal residence capital gains. But if designed right so it also collects information about rental accommodation and rents it could also provide an invaluable source of information on the rental market, as well as an enforcement mechanism (teeth!) for the Residential Tenancy Act in the hard to regulate secondary rental market, which we know is <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2022046-eng.htm">the segment where most evictions in Canada occur</a>. As for an increased build-out of non-profit housing, it may also have to be accompanied by provincial overrides of municipal powers to block housing. So we’ll need the teeth even here.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-new-ministry-of-housing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-new-ministry-of-housing">A new Ministry of Housing</h2>
<p>Another announcement was the creation of a dedicated standalone ministry of housing, a role that previously was passed around as something closer to a side-job. We believe this is a positive development, housing is important to the wellbeing of the people in British Columbia, as well as the overall economy. And housing is complex, having a dedicated minister and staff should help create the expertise and knowledge within the government needed to insure it’s forming good policy and promoting that policy in an accurate manner to the public at large.</p>
<p>Here we definitely see room for improvement. Not just when it comes to some of the issues already outlined above. It’s important for ministers to get simple things right, like the <a href="https://youtu.be/dgA2YrpsaDE?t=1011">the unfortunate claim</a> that “BC has more renters per capita than any part of Canada.” Which is obviously (to anyone who spent any time looking at housing across Canada) false no matter how one slices the data. Here is a simple graph of the share of the population in renter households across Canadian provinces and territories. <img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-11-24-new-premier-new-housing-policy/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>At this point we want to reiterate that we view data transparency and open data for housing (and other data) as extremely important. Current BC policies, while in principle making data available for researchers, impose significant friction that slow down and stymie housing research, and selling the data to private interests creates an information asymmetry with respect to the public as well as municipalities and governments without the same resources for utilizing the data. That information asymmetry erodes trust and is potentially harmful. We have made this point repeatedly on these pages, and have not lost hope that the BC government will change its mind on the role of housing data, especially during a housing crisis. Another item that a minister of housing might be well-positioned to finally address working with a supportive Premier!</p>
</section>
<section id="takeaway" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>We’re happy to see our new Premier add new teeth to housing policy in the service of better supporting and de-stigmatizing renters within strata and bringing municipal corporations on side with getting more housing built. The province is well-positioned to shepherd its “creatures” - BC’s flock of municipal corporations - to where they need to be to get a lot more housing built. The flurry of changes that have been announces are generally good, but could use more work on the details. And we have high hopes we’ll also see more non-toothy announcements soon, including further direct investments in social and affordable housing.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with us. To reward you, here’s a video of some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YtLXrOJBXIU">New Zealand sheepdogs at work</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, the code for this post is <a href="https://github.com/mountainMath/doodles/blob/master/content/posts/2022-11-24-new-premier-new-housing-policy/index.Rmarkdown">available on GitHub</a> for anyone to reproduce or adapt. This includes code for scraping SVT data out of their PDF reports which is necessary only because of BC broken data practices that default to not making data available but hiding it away in reports, if at all. In a similar vein, this post can’t provide more accurate estimates on strata properties with various forms of rental restrictions because this in part requires access to BC Assessment data which the BC government chooses to continue to keep locked up in order to sell it. (The other important ingredient for these estimates is building on work done by Doug Harris who has researched strata restrictions in BC in great detail.)</p>

<p>As a final note, we provide a quick update of Speculation and Vacancy Tax results based upon the newest report. Overall little has changed since our last look at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/11/22/three-years-of-speculation-and-vacancy-tax-data/">three years of data</a>, but more data, more up-to-date, is always better! So here’s a quick summary of where we’re at. The proportion of properties paying the tax continues to decrease, and is now well below 1% across most municipalities. But it was never very high to begin with.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/10/03/still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/06/estimating-suppressed-household-formation/">May we estimated suppressed household formation across Canada</a> using what we called the Montréal Method, finding strong evidence for suppression across many parts of Canada. As a reminder, we designed the Montréal Method to estimate housing shortfalls related to constraints upon current residents who might wish to form independent households but are forced to share by local housing markets. Now that we’ve got 2021 Census data out, it’s time to update our estimates. Given the data available, currently we can only estimate metro area effects of our previous <em>Model 1</em> (crude household maintainer rates) and <em>Model 2</em> (age-adjusted household maintainer rates). But that’s a start, and we’re also now enabled to extend the long timelines for Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver from our previous post to include 2021. Overall, current suppression of households alone suggests a shortfall of over 400,000 dwellings in Metro Toronto, and 130,000-200,000 across Metro Vancouver.</p>
<section id="comparing-2021-to-2016" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparing-2021-to-2016">Comparing 2021 to 2016</h2>
<p>To begin, we look at age-adjusted household maintainer rates across the 20 most populous metro areas in 2016 and 2021, ordered by how much they changed.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/age-adjusted-metros-overview-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The picture we see shows some areas with increases in age-adjusted household maintainer rates, especially in Québec, but most show reductions, especially in in the Greater Toronto Area, implying it’s gotten harder to set up an independent household there.</p>
<p>Age-adjusted rates can mask how household maintainer rates are shifting across age groups, but looking at Canada overall the picture is quite consistent with reductions in household maintainer rates through almost all age groups.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/age-speciic-canada-overview-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Reductions in maintaining an independent household are particularly pronounced in the 25 to 34 year old age groups, but we also see marked declines in the 70+ age range. Let’s break this out by metro area geography to pick up any differences.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/age-speciic-metros-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Metro variation is marked! Toronto shows decreasing household maintainer rates for ages below the late 50s, and increases above that. Québec shows increases in household maintainer rates generally across the board. Vancouver shows decreases for ages 35 through 50, whereas Hamilton, Oshawa, Victoria, and Halifax show decreases for almost all but the oldest age group. We also want to note the very different levels of age-specific household maintainer rates, with Québec and Montréal showing higher rates in all age groups than most of their peers, and Toronto having lower rates than most.</p>
</section>
<section id="caveats" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caveats">2021 caveats</h2>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that 2021 wasn’t a usual census year. People’s locations in May of 2021, in particular, were heavily impacted by the first year of the COVID-19 epidemic and its whiplash effects on things like local employment, on-campus university enrollments, and the movements of elders into long-term care. How all these trends might impact household maintainer rates still remains quite speculative. In some cases, trends might’ve even cancelled one another out. For example young adults moving back in with their parents during COVID might’ve reduced household maintainer rates even as young adults formerly living as roommates might’ve split up into separate apartments as part of social distancing efforts, boosting household maintainer rates within the same age range.</p>
<p>Deaths from COVID could also influence maintainer rates directly, particularly for the older adults most vulnerable to the virus. That said, some of the largest impacts were contained within long-term care homes, and thus outside of the population within private households we’re looking at here.</p>
</section>
<section id="timelines" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="timelines">Timelines</h2>
<p>Let’s pull out our three biggest Metro areas for longer timelines on age-specific household maintainer rates.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/age-specific-main-metro-timeline-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The strongest observable patterns, as <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/05/06/estimating-suppressed-household-formation/">we noted previously</a>, concern the dramatic historical declines in household maintainership for young adults in Toronto and Vancouver. By contrast young adults saw much greater stability in Montréal, where declines in household maintainership only began to appear quite recently. Adding in the 2021 data indicates that Montréal’s household maintainer rates for young adults have recovered a little from these declines.</p>
<p>Was Montréal’s recovery in independence for young adults about the return of <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/09/28/where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/">cheaper rents</a>? To dig into this a little more we look at rent quartiles of purpose-built rental housing in Montreal, adjusted by CPI and a selection of income measures.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/montreal-adjusted-rent-quartiles-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>When adjusted for inflation or income, rents look like they were increasing or stable prior to the pandemic. But rents dropped across all measures by November of 2020, the last Rental Market Survey prior to the 2021 Census. Of note, income-adjusted estimates of rent for the 2020 data point should be viewed with caution due to impacts of COVID and related supports on incomes. Nevertheless, the data broadly supports the idea that lower rents by 2021 may have boosted household maintainer rates for young adults in Montréal.</p>
<p>To better directly compare metro areas for each age group, We can flip the age-specific household maintainer rate graph by colouring by metro area and faceting by year.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/age-specific-main-metro-timeline-flipped-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This highlights how over time Vancouver and especially Toronto, starting with younger age groups and then moving up the age ranks, have experienced dropping household maintainer rates relative to Montréal.</p>
<p>We’re especially interested in Montréal in part for its potential to serve as a counterfactual for what we might expect household formation to look like in an unconstrained housing market in Canada. But as discussed above, Montréal may not be a clean counter-factual for a non-squeezed housing market any more. Despite what looks like a recent recovery in household formation for young adults, household maintainership remains down relative to previous decades, with signs of dropping household formation in the younger age groups in the last several censuses prior to 2021. So here we add Québec City as a second counter-factual, just to give an alternative scenario for a place where households appear to form quite easily.</p>
<p>While Québec City provides us a second counterfactual to consider, there are factors other than age that might impact household formation, and our <em>Model 3</em> of our previous post tries to get at that, loosely labelling this factor as “culture”. What generally gets captured under “culture” is confounded by other important factors, chiefly income. And there is a real danger of attributing lower household formation rates of certain groups to “culture” when in reality it’s just systemic barriers leading to lower incomes that are partially or chiefly responsible for historic differential household formation rates across “culture”. We can’t run our <em>Model 3</em> yet given the limited data available for 2021, but we want to point out that Québec City is culturally very homogeneous which may skew the results to the extent that “culture” plays a role in household formation. Montréal is much more culturally diverse and similar to other large Canadian metro areas, and in that sense we view the Montréal scenario as a more robust counter-factual despite recent signs of slowing household formation in younger age groups. So view the Québec scenario with appropriate caution!</p>
<p>For our new estimates, We start out by asking by how many households each metro area would have to grow to achieve the same (age-specific) household maintainer rates as Montréal or Québec.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/shortfall-metros-shares-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Using either Montréal or Québec as the standard, we see that our selected metro areas would all have to increase their dwelling stock dramatically to make space for households to be able to form in line with our counter-factual scenarios. The estimated shortage is particularly pronounced if we take Québec City as the counter-factual. Toronto tops the list with a housing shortfall of around 20% of it’s existing dwelling stock.</p>
<p>Importantly, this shortfall estimate doesn’t account for migration. For example, this shortfall only accounts for the population that already lives in Toronto. If Toronto were to add housing it would likely pull in people that have been pushed out of the metro area to neighbouring areas like Oshawa or Hamilton, easing pressures there but in turn dampening the effect of the added housing in Toronto on boosting household maintainership rates.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can translate this into hard numbers of how many concealed households we have in each metro area. Put slightly differently, we can ask how many more housing units we would need to allow the existing population to form households at the same rates as in our counter-factual metro areas of Montréal or Québec.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/shortfall-metros-totals-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This puts a rough estimate on the number of suppressed households, or alternatively the number of additional dwellings needed to bring household formation rates up to counter-factual levels. The number for Metro Toronto is staggering. Between the 1970s, when Toronto had similar household maintainer rates as Montréal, and 2021, Metro Toronto has accumulated a shortage of over 400k homes, and that’s still not accounting for migration effects or moving vacancies.</p>
<p>For Metro Vancouver this pegs the number of suppressed households at somewhere between 130k and 200k, depending on the counter-factual scenario. Again, not accounting for migration or moving vacancies. That corresponds to between 6 and 10 years worth of recent completions, not accounting for demolitions, just to remove the current shortfall, while holding current population constant (narrator voice: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2022-2024.html">it will not be held constant</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="comparison-numbers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison-numbers">Comparison Numbers</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/898373/Sofa_surfing_fact_sheet.pdf">English Housing Survey measures ‘concealed households’ directly</a>, something that would be great to have in Canada too as part of the <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=5269">Canadian Housing Survey</a>. In England the share of ‘concealed households’ came out at 7% in their 2018-2019 survey. Our <em>Model 2</em> comes out with between 7% and 13% of concealed households for Canada overall, depending on the counter-factual scenario. Having a direct measurement to benchmark these estimates against would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>Another useful comparison is to see how these estimates stack up against CMHC supply shortfall estimates. The CMHC estimates were done very differently from our Montréal Method. CMHC relied on prices to fit a (modified) <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119084710011">DiPasquale-Wheaton model</a> to data from Canadian provinces and asked what it would take to get prices to specified levels. The CMHC report did not break out the “current” (2019) shortfall, but only the projected 2030 shortfall under a business-as-usual scenario. But the presentation on this work at this year’s CEA conference did break out the 2019 “current” shortfall, which can provide a useful benchmark for us.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-10-03-still-short-suppressed-households-in-2021/index_files/figure-html/cmhc-shortfall-comparison-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The CMHC housing shortfall estimates for Ontario are roughly consistent with our more aggressive Québec counter-factual scenario. But for the other provinces they differ significantly; they are lower for Alberta and higher in Quebec and British Columbia than our suppressed household estimates.</p>
<p>One reason for this discrepancy is migration, which, to first order, is implicitly included in the CMHC model but is completely missing from our demographics-based estimates. In particular, it is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/poll-canadians-comfortable-living-1.6302361">very plausible</a> that in-migration into British Columbia from other parts of Canada would increase significantly if prices were lower. And a good portion of this increase might come from Alberta, easing the need for more housing there. On the other hand, single-region models like the one employed by CMHC might be double-counting demand when people get priced out of a region and buy or rent elsewhere. Some econometric models building on DiPasquale-Wheaton, like the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/24/1/79/481193">models developed by Geoffry Meen</a>, avoid this by modelling migration effects explicitly.</p>
<p>Apart from not accounting for migration pressures, our household suppressing estimates only look at households and not at how many dwelling units are needed. The number of dwelling units would always have to be larger than the number of households to account for moving vacancies, as well as increase the rental vacancy rate to a healthy level to allow freer household formation that is not constrained by landlord bargaining power.</p>
</section>
<section id="takeaway" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>Housing discussions often get caught up in overly simplistic mental models of how housing works. Here we start to explore just one process involving how housing works for distributing people into households. Thinking through the process enables us to estimate household suppression. This formulates one aspect of the consequences of housing scarcity in terms of demographics, and how it interferes with life trajectories.</p>
<p>Often calls for building more housing are justified or discredited by pointing to past population growth and population growth projections. But this misses the central endogeneity problem. The number of dwelling units constitute a hard cap on the number of households that can form. When housing is scarce, both population growth and household formation slow down. A <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/05/25/projections-and-self-fulfilling-prophecies/">housing provision model that ignores suppressed household formation and migration becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy</a>, and <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/04/26/planning-for-scarcity/">systematically enshrines housing scarcity</a>.</p>
<p>While prices and rents are the best indicator of housing scarcity, there are those who doubt that prices and rents are related to scarcity, despite <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/02/18/vacancy-rates-and-rent-change-2021-update/">ample evidence to the contrary</a>. This points toward the value of exhibiting the effects of housing scarcity directly on demographics and people’s life trajectories, without making any reference to prices. Moreover, many people seem to have higher sympathy for the welfare of existing residents as opposed to newcomers, and might be more willing to understand the detrimental effects of housing scarcity when phrased in terms of the existing population, rather than more abstractly thought prices and rents, or migration pressures. We have made a similar attempt to highlight the <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/08/27/keeping-the-leavers/">people leaving the region</a> instead of looking at net population flows.</p>
<p>At the individual level, the decisions of individuals to form or not form households, or to move into or out of a region, are generally driven by prices and rents. And the ability and willingness to pay determines the outcome. When added up, these individual decisions set the market price and rent of housing. Prices are information aggregators, and the shortcut to all of this is to simply look at prices and rents as the main indicator of housing scarcity, which is what <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/blog/2022/canadas-housing-supply-shortage-restoring-affordability-2030">econometric models like the ones in the recent CMHC report on Canada’s Housing Supply Shortage</a> do. So maybe, with this additional demographic context, we can pay more attention to those econometric models and build more housing. We can do this both for the population that’s already here so young people can form households and families, and also to make room for the people that left or that did not come, and for those intending to come in the future, those not wanting to leave in the future, and those wanting and <a href="https://bcsth.ca/">needing</a> to form new households in the future.</p>

</p>
<p>It can be really useful to count things, but sometimes numbers end up causing confusion and misunderstanding rather than helping. Often this has to do with how the number is presented and attached to claims. Other times it has to do with problematic procedures used to obtain the number. Here we want to explore these problems more in detail concerning a claim that <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/vancouver/article-even-as-housing-plans-progress-truly-affordable-housing-is-being-lost/">“Canada lost 322,000 affordable homes” between 2011 and 2016</a>. This stat is generally made in reference to “private” rentals, and is contrasted to the number of non-market units built between 2011 and 2016, pegged at 60k units.</p>
<p>At its best, the claim has been used to advocate for more non-profit housing. This is a great thing to advocate for, and something we support. At its worst, the claim has been made to look like a popular NIMBY talking point: that development of new housing, including non-profit, is directly resulting in the loss of older more affordable housing stock, resulting in worse overall affordability. While this can occur in specific cases (especially when we only allow new apartment buildings to be developed on top of old apartment buildings), as a general claim it’s wrong and misleading on multiple levels. So let’s walk through where the number is coming from and how it’s being presented.</p>
<p>The headline number is based on <a href="https://www.focus-consult.com/why-canada-needs-a-non-market-rental-acquisition-strategy/">an estimation by Steve Pomeroy</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The erosion of “naturally occurring affordable housing” (NOAH) units is the most serious threat to Canada’s supply of affordable housing. Between 2011 and 2016 the number of private rental units affordable to households earning less than $30,000 per year (rents below $750) declined by 322,600 units — a trend that appears to be continuing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will temporarily set aside the problematic term “naturally occurring affordable housing,” except to link to this <a href="https://cityobservatory.org/the-myth-of-naturally-occurring-affordable-housing/">critical history of the term</a> and note that left to nature, <a href="https://www.loveproperty.com/gallerylist/65542/homes-that-lost-the-fight-with-mother-nature">housing invariably decays</a> (something that can also be <a href="https://vimeo.com/151753760">observed in parts of Vancouver where zoning bylaws force unproductive land use</a>). Let’s dive into the number. In the report referenced, this stat is only broadly sourced to the 2016 Census and 2011 NHS with no indication how it was estimated. But <a href="https://pub-hamilton.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=256198">this document outlines one way that does line up with the headline number</a>. It takes a <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=110571&amp;PRID=10&amp;PTYPE=109445&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2017&amp;THEME=121&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=">data table from the 2016 census that enumerates non-subsidized rental households paying below $750 in rent and utilities</a>, and a <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=7&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=S&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=0&amp;PID=106661&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=94&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=Shelter%20cost%20groups%20%2811%29&amp;VNAMEF=Tranches%20de%20coûts%20d%27habitation%20%2811%29">data table from the 2011 NHS</a> with slightly different cutoffs where the $750 cutoff was estimated by linear interpolation between the rent cutoffs in the table.</p>
<p>Using linear interpolation assumes that shelter costs are uniformly distributed in the $600-$800 range, which is tenuous at best. Shelter costs will skew high within this band, which would under-estimate the “loss”. At the same time one has to ask why nominal shelter cost levels should be used for this instead of adjusting for inflation or income growth.</p>
<p>Setting these questions aside, a quick cross-check with this method shows a net loss of 322,700 households in non-subsidized rental housing paying $750 or less on rent and utilities, matching the number cited in the research report (assuming the report truncated instead of rounded to the nearest 100). We will assume that this is how the number was constructed, as the estimated difference between 2011 to 2016 in households not living in subsidized housing or receiving rent subsidies paying at most $750 in rent and utilities. (If one were to adjust for inflation, using $701 as the starting rents in 2011, then the loss would amount to 103,000 households, adjusting in the other direction using $802 in 2016 this method comes out with a gain of 654,100 units, which is absurd and highlights the issue of using linear interpolation, in this case to estimate households below the $802 cutoff in the $750-$1000 band.)</p>
<p>Now with the newest 2021 census data, we don’t need to interpolate using standard tables and can read off that between 2016 and 2021 another 230,500 fewer non-subsidized renter households were paying less than $750 in rent and utilities. So we can extend the claim forward. We can also push the claim back to 1996, although at the cost of grouping subsidized and non-subsidized rental housing and losing households with zero income in 2006 and earlier, to see a longer timeline of the number of units renting below $750.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>In short, the number of tenant households in subsidized or market rental &amp; paying rents below $750 has been declining for quite some time now.</p>
<section id="how-should-we-interpret-this-320k-statistic" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-should-we-interpret-this-320k-statistic">How should we interpret this 320k statistic?</h2>
<p>The research note that introduced this loss of “322,600 units” interprets it in the following way:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These losses are driven chiefly by the financialization of rental housing – an asset class attracting investment from both large capital funds, as well as smaller investors, both seeking to capitalize on dramatically rising rents). A further contributor is the intensification and redevelopment of sites with older low-moderate rent properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately no argument is made to fully define or support these claims. And they’re pretty big claims involving a variety of potential processes and lots of room for confusion. Perhaps the biggest generator of confusion is that rents in Canada are generally not tied to units. Instead they’re mostly tied to rental contracts between landlords and tenant households. Here these rents are reported by tenant households. Rental contracts can provide stability and protect tenants from rent increases - especially in places like BC that have rent control. But they disappear when tenants move, resulting in turnover for units and new contracts offered to new tenants. And <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/07/29/tumbling-turnover/">tenants move a lot</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the decline in households reporting rents below $750 generally doesn’t reflect a loss of units, but rather turnover in rental contracts. Labeling our number properly as tied to tenancies, as we attempt to do above, may help ward off a lot of confusion. When tenants move out, landlords tend to set new rents for their units. In a remarkably predictable dynamic, these <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/02/18/vacancy-rates-and-rent-change-2021-update/">rents go up when vacancy rates are low, and go down when vacancy rates are high</a>. Landlords setting higher rents on units that have turned over in conditions of scarcity probably explains most of the decline in rental contracts paying below $750 in rent. You could term this process “financialization” if you want to, but it’s not clear how it helps explain the underlying dynamic. “Filtering” is likely a better name for the process, reflecting how units tend to “filter down,” becoming cheaper as they age in places where housing is abundant, but can instead <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tsur-Somerville-2/publication/239823323_Dynamics_of_the_Affordable_Housing_Stock_Microdata_Analysis_of_Filtering/links/53ea282c0cf2fb1b9b6766e3/Dynamics-of-the-Affordable-Housing-Stock-Microdata-Analysis-of-Filtering.pdf">“filter up,”</a> becoming more expensive, in places where housing is scarce.</p>
<p>But let’s get back to the number.</p>
</section>
<section id="affordability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="affordability">Affordability</h2>
<p>The stated motivation for this statistic is to understand “naturally occurring affordable housing”, and the $750 shelter cost threshold was chosen because this level is “affordable to households earning less than $30,000 per year.” This relies on the standard affordability criterion of spending no more than 30% of total income on shelter costs. The change in the number of households paying less than $750 on rent and utilities is one side of the affordability equation, the change in the humber of households earning less than $30k is the other. We could reasonably improve housing affordability either by working to keep rents low or by providing better income supports to people. So far we’ve only looked at rents, so let’s take a peek at households below $30,000 in income. In 2016 there were 128,500 fewer households in this income band than in 2011 living in non-subsidized housing. And by 2021 there were another 363,600 fewer households in that income range.</p>
<p>Again, if we look at all renter households, including those in subsidized housing, we can extend that timeframe back to 1996 (again dropping households with zero income in 2006 or earlier) and tally up how many households had income below $30k in the year preceding each census year.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The bump between 1996 and 2001 likely reflects simple household growth through a time period when $30,000 was still a decent income, but it could also result in part from a methods change in how households and incomes were counted. Regardless, since 2001 there’s been a strong decline in tenant households reporting less than $30,000 in income. It doesn’t fully match the more steady decline in rents less than $750, and may also be complicated by recent pandemic-related income supports, which together with methods changes make income harder to track than rents, but we can see real change. In other words, the decline in households paying low rents (&lt;$750) roughly tracked the decline in households with low incomes (&lt;$30,000). Nevertheless, there remain more of the latter than the former, suggesting real rent burdens.</p>
<p>Rather than examining changing rents and incomes in isolation, another approach is to look directly at rent burdens, i.e.&nbsp;what proportion of income is going toward rent for households with income below $30,000. Here we’ll only look at those in non-subsidized housing. We’ll also keep in mind that there’s an important lag between reporting of incomes (mostly drawn from tax records for the year prior to the Census) and rents (estimated as contemporaneous with the Census). As a result, some situations where it looks like people are paying a very high proportion of their incomes on rent may arise simply because they just graduated or moved to Canada and started a new job (with income not yet recorded) at the same time as they moved into a new place (where we get their new rent). We’ll come back to this point. But for now, keeping this caveat in mind, let’s take a look at the data!</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Overall, the most common situation for low-income households without subsidies is to be paying 30%-50% of incomes on rent. This doesn’t leave a lot of room for other expenses. On the bright side, we can see the decline in unsubsidized households with incomes below $30k, and we can also see that the low-income households remaining in 2021 are less and less likely to be paying more than half their income in rent, continuing a pattern of decline observable since 2011. So from that perspective, that’s an improvement. But we shouldn’t overstate it. Overall, looked at distributionally, little has changed concerning the rent burden for those households making under $30,000.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The relative lack of movement in this metric fits pretty well with the observable decline in both the number of households paying less than $750 in rent and the number of households making less than $30,000 in annual income. We’d like to see more improvement, but it’s not clear that things are getting noticeably worse.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-geography-of-cheap-rent" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-geography-of-cheap-rent">The Geography of Cheap Rent</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the geography of cheap rent. Where are the tenant households with shelter cost below $750, and where are we seeing the most losses of these kinds of rental contracts? We can pull this data from the cross tabulation we have used above. To reduce clutter we will break out the 20 biggest Metro Areas (CMAs) in Canada, and lump everything else together.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/cheap-rent-region-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We see that cheap rent is most common outside of Metropolitan Canada (as represented by the top 20 CMAs), though Montréal also still retains a lot of tenant households paying less than $750 in rent. Correspondingly, Montréal and more rural parts of Canada are also where we’ve seen the biggest recent declines in low-rent households. Strange, then, that the focus on <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/vancouver/article-even-as-housing-plans-progress-truly-affordable-housing-is-being-lost/">reporting</a> about these losses often shifts to Vancouver or Toronto, where there are very few such rental contracts remaining. This speaks to a broader problem with the potential for any headline number for Canada to mislead insofar as it combines data from very different housing markets across the country.</p>
<p>We can look at this more directly by showing the loss of renter households with shelter cost less that $750 in each region and inter-census period.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/cheap-rent-region-change-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This again highlights that most of the losses were in Montréal and regions outside of the main metro areas. The number of households with shelter cost below $750 in Calgary and Edmonton increasing 2016-2021 shows that this isn’t necessarily a one-way street. Units renting below $750 at any given point in time aren’t separate from the rest of the housing market, and their asking rents can go up or down depending upon what’s going on elsewhere in the market.</p>
</section>
<section id="further-exploration-into-low-rent" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="further-exploration-into-low-rent">Further exploration into Low Rent</h2>
<p>Let’s dig a little deeper, drawing upon public use micro file (PUMF) data. Unfortunately this hasn’t been released yet for the 2021 Census, so we’ll only be able to look at 2011 and 2016 data, coming from the long-form NHS and Census samples. For 2016, these samples come in both individual and hierarchical form (including complete households), and we’ll include both here for reference. Using PUMF data adds uncertainty due to lower sample size, but adds much greater flexibility. First let’s look at a simple distribution of what rents those paying less than $750 a month are paying for each sample.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We can see that most rents are (perhaps not surprisingly) at the upper end of the distribution, with $700 a month being the most common. This suggests that there’s nothing intrinsically separating market housing renting under $750 from the rest of the housing market. There’s nothing “natural” about its affordability except that its on the low end of the overall distribution of rents. As the overall distribution shifts rightward, its affordable tail at the left end gets smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>Other noticeable issues include the difference in results when using the individuals vs the hierarchical PUMF data, with only minimal overlap in the confidence intervals. This is a good reminder of the inherent difficulties when working with PUMF data. Another interesting observation is that renters renting below $300 have increased 2011-2016. These are likely non-arms length rentals, which we’ve yet to discuss another issue complicating analysis. <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2021/08/13/commodity-and-keeping-it-in-the-family/">Not all of these “market rentals” actually represent market processes.</a></p>
<p>Let’s use our flexibility to break down tenancies with rents below $750 by age of primary household maintainer.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The zigzag (or double hump) pattern here is fascinating, with concentrations in both the early Millennial (born 1986-1991) and late Boomer (born 1956-1966). This may reflect simple demographics (these were larger cohorts than the intervening Gen Xers), but may also be picking up on other patterns, with variation in both quality and geographic distribution of low rent tenancies by age (keeping in mind that most of these renters are in more rural parts of Canada and bigger metros in Quebec). We’ll circle back to look at these patterns in a moment, but first let’s take a look at what was renting for less than $750 in 2016 by number of bedrooms.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>No surprise, mostly 1BR and 2BR dwellings. We can also look at the type of dwelling households paying less than $750 in rent tend to live in.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The vast majority of low rent situations seem to involve non-condo apartments, representing both purpose-built rental buildings and secondary suites in homes. Once again, it’s worth keeping in mind that these are mostly showing up in Quebec and more rural parts of Canada.</p>
<p>Checking by period of construction of the building we see that most of these households live in buildings constructed between 1946 and 1980 or 1990.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Most low rent situations involve older buildings. But this age distribution also generally fits the age-distribution of our purpose-built rental stock in Canada, largely constructed during a mid-Twentieth Century build-out prior to the rise of the condominium (where we see far fewer being rented out at below $750). Aging stock is also more likely to be in poor condition, drawing a clear connection between rents and quality of housing. A fair amount of preventive maintenance is needed to keep old buildings habitable, and the more they fall into disrepair, the cheaper their rents tend to go relative to surrounding alternatives. There’s nothing “natural” about keeping older housing inhabitable.</p>

<section id="time-lag-bias-in-shelter-cost-to-income-ratios" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-lag-bias-in-shelter-cost-to-income-ratios">Time Lag Bias in Shelter Cost to Income Ratios</h2>
<p>Let’s exploit the flexibility of our microdata to return to our exploration of those on the other side of the low rent affordability issue: households with incomes below $30k. As we noted before, some of the particularly high ratios, where it seems like tenants are paying extraordinary portions of their incomes on rents, may be accounted for by time lags between reporting incomes and rents. This can especially be an issue for recent immigrants and new graduates who might have landed both a good job and new apartment prior to the census, but lack income records from the year prior to the census. We can help account for this by pulling out recent movers (those moving in the last year). What do their shelter cost to income ratios look like if we actually separate non-movers from recent movers?</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We can see that when we separate them out, non-movers in the past year with low household incomes (&lt;$30,000) reported for the year prior are mostly concentrated in the range of those paying between 30% to 50% of their income on rent. By contrast, the highest category for movers with low incomes is those paying 100% or more of their income on rent. This likely reflects the lag effect, where movers current incomes (at least within Canada) are likely much higher when they fill out Census forms about their rents, than in the year prior, when the Census attempts to assign their income.</p>
<p>Computing the ratio of households that moved in the past year for each shelter cost to income band makes this relationship even more clear. The time lag between reported incomes and reported rents likely produces a real upward bias in shelter cost to income ratios. We can partly account for this bias by separating out mobility, but it’s imperfect, and analysts drawing upon this metric - including for the construction of <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/core-housing-need">Core Housing Needs measures</a>! - should really keep this bias in mind.</p>

<section id="rents-in-the-primary-rental-market" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rents-in-the-primary-rental-market">Rents in the Primary Rental Market</h2>
<p>Let’s draw in one more source of data to keep triangulating our exploration of low rents. In particular, let’s look at the primary rental market. This gets surveyed annually by CMHC through their <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/rental-market/rental-market-report-data-tables">Rental Market Survey (RMS)</a> and looking at rent bands by quartile gives some indication how this market has changed. Deeper access to CMHC data could answer the question how rent has changed in individual buildings, and how many of these have gotten torn down or received deep renovations. But publicly available data can give a broad overview.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Our broadest overview of the primary rental market shows that the percentile bands of rent levels have continuously increased between 2006 and 2021. If we assume that the rents are evenly distributed between these 25th and 50th percentile we can estimate what share of the rental stock rented below $750 in 2011 and 2016, and folding in data on the total stock of purpose built rental housing we can estimate the loss of such units.</p>
<p>This method gives a rough estimate of 125,500 fewer primary market rental units in 2016 renting below $750 compared to 2011. This is based on rent, which may include some utilities, but generally not all of them, so it’s a slightly different estimate than what we used above.</p>
<p>In the purpose-built market the RMS estimated a total of around 842,864 units renting below $750 in 2011, compared to the census estimate of 1,408,306 households with shelter cost below $750 in 2011. As we noted those two aren’t directly comparable because the RMS rent does not include all utilities, but also because the RMS coverage has gaps outside of census metropolitan areas. But it’s probably fair to say that somewhere between half to maybe 60% of all households with shelter cost below $750 were renting in the primary market. Adding to that that some of the households with shelter cost below $750 were in non-arms length rentals, understanding what happened in the primary market can probably provide good context.</p>
<p>As noted above, housing markets are decidedly regional, so it might be useful to see how this pans out across different metropolitan areas.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-27-where-did-all-the-cheap-rents-go/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Matching our census-based analysis, the RMS data shows that Montréal has a high share of purpose-built rental units renting below $750 both in 2011 and 2016, whereas e.g.&nbsp;Toronto doesn’t. We can also see that in Winnipeg and Halifax about half of the units were renting below $750 in 2011, dropping to 25% in 2016 and likely very few left by 2021, whereas in Montréal about 75% of units were renting below $750 in 2011, with still a little over 50% renting below that cutoff in 2016 and over a quarter in 2021.</p>
<p>But how should one interpret this? That’s where things get tricky. RMS data alone does not answer why there are fewer units below this rent cutoff over the years. Or across metro areas. There are many different processes at play, from the location and state of repair/quality of rental units to the bedroom mix and size of units, and overall market conditions with scarcity disrupting filtering processes. But there’s no “natural” cut-off between apartments renting below $750 and the rest of the rental market. Instead, we can see that different price points in the distribution of rental contracts tend to move up and down together. In other words, we don’t see strong segmentation of the rental market, and instead see evidence of upward and downward filtering at work. So where there’s high demand, halting the addition of new apartments will place increased price pressure on old apartments, shifting their rents further upward.</p>
<p>Analyzing this in more detail unfortunately goes beyond the scope of this post, but we do want to quickly highlight how bedroom mix and change in overall purpose-built rental units vary across metro areas.</p>

<p>Montreal and Québec have a relatively high share of of 2 and 3 bedroom units, which makes their high share of units renting below $750 even more impressive. They also have a high share of overall purpose-built rental units in their CMAs, and they have been adding on that over the years. Toronto and Vancouver, on the other hand, have been relatively flat in their overall stock of purpose-built rental units due to a mixture of modest additions and some loss due to conversion and demolitions.</p>
<p>To round this off we can narrow down to look specifically at the rent distribution of 2-bedroom purpose-built rental units across metro regions.</p>

<p>Only Montréal has a good share of their 2-bedroom purpose-built rental units renting below $750, with a little over 25% of them still renting below that cutoff in 2021. In Toronto and Vancouver 2-bedroom apartments renting below $750 have been exceedingly rare since at least 2006.</p>

<section id="takeaway" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>What happens in the cheaper portions of the housing market is really important, demonstrating where the greatest risk of homelessness lies, and where the greatest need for non-market housing can be found. The headline number of 322,000 “lost units” renting below $750 calls useful attention to this portion of the housing market, but unfortunately it’s often misleading on multiple levels. To review just a few of the ways it can mislead:</p>
<ul>
<li>The statistic is mostly about changes in contracts between tenants and landlords, specifying rents below $750, and is not generally otherwise tied to units of housing</li>
<li>The statistic refers to shelter cost of households, rather than referring directly to rents.</li>
<li>The $750 figure is nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation or for growth in incomes.</li>
<li>Without consideration of incomes, the stat says little about change in affordability.</li>
<li>Interpretations frequently advanced to explain the “loss” don’t hold up, there is no indication that this losses in rental contracts below $750 are driven by REITs or by demolitions of old rental buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The much more immediate interpretation is that scarcity is driving up rents, leading to older units filtering up. This leads to the opposite implications of common NIMBY talking points that old housing is “naturally” affordable. It’s only affordable if enough new housing is built to soak up demand that would otherwise draw up the lower portions of the housing market into higher overall rents.</p>
<p>Additionally, using nominal rents is not very useful. We could adjust for inflation to (crudely) account for increased costs to build and operate rental buildings. Or adjust for income growth to account for people’s ability to pay. Instead of focusing on rent or shelter costs we should probably focus on affordability, as measured by shelter cost to income ratios. When looking at the impacts of “financialization” and/or REITs on the rental market we need to do better to support our arguments with data. (We will discuss this more in a separate post.)</p>
<p>Non of this negates the dire need we have for more housing. The need to dramatically expand our non-market housing options was already clear in 2011, and it is still urgently needed in 2021. Acquiring old purpose-built rental housing is a fine stop-gap strategy to assist in stabilizing rents for current tenants, but by itself the strategy does little to add badly needed housing stock and often comes with outsized maintenance costs and accessibility concerns. We can and should build a lot more new non-market housing. We also need a dramatic expansion of our market housing, especially in high-demand areas, to slow or even reverse the growth in rents and prices beyond the increases in construction costs. Housing abundance, distributed both within and outside of market processes, probably offers our best shot at finding more cheap rent.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/09/12/rent-growth-in-gdp/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>Every now and then the topic of the GDP share of the “Real Estate Industry” comes up, often linked to the suggestion that an economy has become too dependent upon real estate. But this usually involves a fundamental misreading of the data. As people who pay attention know, the NAICS sector [53] “Real Estate Industry” of the expenditure based GDP produced by StatCan <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2018/02/01/real-estate-industry/">is mostly just rent and imputed rent</a>.</p>
<p>Imputed rent, as a reminder, is simply how much owner-occupiers would be paying themselves to live in their residences if their roles were split into tenant and landlord components. We can estimate this based on how much the dwelling would fetch if rented out at prevailing market rents. There are technical details as to why and how this is done, and what makes them challenging, all of which we’ll save for another post, but they are reasonably accurate enough for our purposes in this post. What they point toward is that the relative size of the “Real Estate Industry” is largely just a measure of rent as share of GDP.</p>
<p>To start we take a look at just the rent and imputed rent part of the GDP by province. We can also talk about this rent portion as Housing Consumption.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-12-rent-growth-in-gdp/index_files/figure-html/gdp_rent_share-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>The share of GDP going toward housing consumption has been rising in all provinces since the early to mid 2000s, with BC consistently taking the top spot and the gap to the Canadian mean widening. Nova Scotia takes the second spot throughout, and this shows that there are two things going on at once. A province can have a high share of GDP going toward housing consumption because they spend a lot of money on rent (and imputed rent), or because GDP is low. To disentangle this a little we can look at housing consumption per capita instead of as a percent of total GDP.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-12-rent-growth-in-gdp/index_files/figure-html/gdp_rent_capita-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This shows the extraordinary rise of the dollar value of housing consumption in BC. Nova Scotia, by contrast, closely tracks the Canadian average. So these two provinces had a high share of GDP going toward housing consumption for very different reasons. In BC people spend a lot of money on rent (and imputed rent), boosting the numerator, while in Nova Scotia the GDP per capita is relatively low, minimizing our denominator.</p>
<p>This gets us to the question of why people in BC spend a lot of money on rent and imputed rent. Is it because people achieve extraordinary housing outcomes, living in large or very luxurious housing units? Or is it simply because high rent reflects too many people bidding for too little housing? In the first case, we’d expect things like the floor space of housing consumption to be much higher in BC. In the second, we’d expect it to be roughly the same, or smaller (bound, perhaps, primarily by regulatory constraints on <a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/council-memo-02-24-2022-current-policy-and-regulation-on-dwelling-unit-sizes.pdf">minimum dwelling size</a>).</p>
<p>Robust Canada-wide metrics on housing quality and size are relatively hard to come by, but the Canadian Housing Statistics Program is now publishing average and median living areas in three Canadian Provinces, with hopefully more to come. So that gives us one view into this question.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-09-12-rent-growth-in-gdp/index_files/figure-html/living_area-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Among these three provinces it does not appear that BC residents have substantially larger homes, with maybe the exception of single detached homes. Indeed, BC is often accused of having apartments that are too small. Overall, while there are some very nice homes in BC, it seems unreasonable that explains more than a small portion of the 45% higher housing consumption per capita BC residents pay over the Canadian average. It’s really hard to conclude that BC’s high housing consumption cost is due to anything but high rents.</p>
<section id="takeaway" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>So what does all of that mean? Housing consumption makes up a very high share of GDP in BC because rents are so high. People have to spend a lot of money on rent and don’t have that much money left over for other things. For the individual that restricts their quality of life. For the province overall it leads to reduced economic growth with money being spent on rent instead of other consumption goods that can help grow the economy.</p>
<p>So what should be done about that? It’s simple really, <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/02/18/vacancy-rates-and-rent-change-2021-update/">we know very well how overall housing availability impacts rents</a>. It may seem like a paradox, but to lower the GDP share of the “Real Estate Industry” we really need to build a lot more housing.</p>

</p>
<p>How are big Canadian Metros growing? Can we see different patterns? Here we want to provide a brief look back at the last 25 years, exploring change over time from 1996 to our most recent Census in 2021. This is also a test of R skills for one of us, who began this post as a learning exercise drawing upon <a href="https://github.com/mountainMath">Jens</a>’ excellent <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cancensus/vignettes/cancensus.html">CanCensus package</a> and recent data updates.</p>
<p>Here we’re simply going to compare housing stock by dwelling type in 1996 and 2021 for Canada’s big three metro areas (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver) and Calgary (effectively tied with Ottawa &amp; Edmonton for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_census_metropolitan_areas_and_agglomerations_in_Canada">fourth place</a>). What this allows for is a peek at how the housing stock of these metro areas has changed as they’ve grown. There are caveats to this quick look, of course. The two most prominent being that the definitions of housing structure and the boundaries of metro areas may have changed. We have written before about the <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/01/27/mythical-oversupply/">change to Census methods</a> and the problems this creates for <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/02/01/no-shortage-in-housing-bs/">analysis of housing stock</a> (in particular we picked up a lot more secondary suites as Duplexes after 2006).</p>
<p>The Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary CMA boundaries have stayed the same across those 25 years, but the boundaries of Metro Montréal have changed significantly (more about the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92f0138m/92f0138m2019002-eng.htm">CMA concept here</a>). As we will be taking differences of dwelling counts between these years it’s important to harmonize these boundaries, and we choose the 2021 CMA boundaries for that by simply intersecting 1996 CSDs with the 2021 CMA boundaries and keeping those with large overlap. That leaves us with some very minor mismatch where CSD boundaries have changed over the years which should not skew our results in meaningful ways. Keeping this in mind, let’s take a peek!</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-08-18-25-years-of-structural-change/index_files/figure-html/households-by-type-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We can see that all four of our metro areas grew quite a bit between 1996 and 2021, adding hundreds of thousands of households. But they varied in the different kinds of dwelling type or structure new households occupied. Let’s shift our stacked bar chart so that we get percent of households occupying each type.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-08-18-25-years-of-structural-change/index_files/figure-html/households-by-type-shares-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Here we can more clearly see the different compositions of each Metro area. In particular, we can see that Calgary consistently has the largest proportion of households living in single-family detached houses, while Montréal remains predominantly low-rise and Toronto dominates the high-rise category. Vancouver increasingly appears somewhere between Toronto &amp; Montréal in terms of its balance between low-rise and high-rise.</p>
<p>Of particular interest, between 1996 and 2021 Vancouver surpassed both Toronto and Montréal to become the large North American metro area least dominated by single-family detached houses. But it did so in no small part by transforming (and having the Census reclassify) many of its single-family houses as duplexes, i.e.&nbsp;houses containing separate basement suites. As argued in <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2016/11/02/media-coverage-of-my-book/">Nathan’s book</a>, this renovation of existing single-family housing stock remains the “sneakiest” way Vancouver has added to its density. But Vancouver has also continued to more visibly add low-rise and high-rise apartments.</p>
<p>Let’s look more directly at how new households have been added across each of our big metros across the last quarter century. Below we simply subtract occupied housing stock in 1996 from occupied housing stock in 2021, leaving us with net change in each category.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-08-18-25-years-of-structural-change/index_files/figure-html/structural-change-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We can see that Calgary has mostly been adding more single-family detached houses to accommodate its new households, continuing to sprawl outward. While Montréal also added a lot more single-family detached houses, some of this addition simply reflected its expanded boundaries, and it also added a relatively balanced mix of duplexes, low-rises, and high-rises. Toronto also sprawled further outward with many single-family detached houses, but also added a lot more row houses and high-rises. Meanwhile, Vancouver actually <em>lost</em> single-family detached houses. Some of these were simply re-categorized as duplexes, either rebuilt or simply recognized as such by the Census after the widespread legalization (or at least <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/06/09/basement-confidential-vancouvers-informal-housing-stock/">general acceptance</a>) of secondary suites across the region. But the decline in single-family detached houses in Vancouver also reflects a very strong set of barriers against further suburban sprawl in the region. In particular, the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/agricultural-land-and-environment/agricultural-land-reserve/the-agricultural-land-reserve">Agricultural Land Reserve</a> has prevented the further transformation of farmland to new subdivisions. As a result, most new growth has been spread across more dense forms of urban infill. Generally speaking, a success in terms of sustainability!</p>
<p>Let’s track this a different way, by looking at the spread of built-up area within and surrounding each big CMA. This data comes from satellite imagery, coded and shared for public use. We’ve <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2021/08/21/satellites-sprawl-and-city-six-packs/">played around with it before</a>. Below we match satellite imagery coding built-up area to 2021 CMA boundaries as determined by Statistics Canada, which is what we used for the comparative graphs above.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-08-18-25-years-of-structural-change/index_files/figure-html/canada-big4-cities-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>We can see larger sections of dark red, indicating recent built-up land, all around the outskirts of Toronto and Calgary. We can also see that the built up area of Toronto spills over its CMA boundaries along the shores of Lake Ontario into neighbouring Hamilton and Oshawa CMAs, while Calgary is near to spilling over its CMA boundary to the South toward Okotoks. The pattern of sprawling growth is more muted in Montréal, but we can see how outlying built-up areas might be integrating with the City, creating an expanded Metropolitan area. Vancouver demonstrates what looks like the least outward growth in built-up area, corresponding well with the dwelling type data from the Census. Those parts of the CMA boundaries still in gray are largely all protected by Vancouver’s various regulations, especially its Agricultural Land Reserve to the South and East, but also topography and parks or reserves to the North. The nearby CMA of Abbottsford is also visible outside of Vancouver CMA boundaries to the SE, and current <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/01/06/flow-maps/">commute patterns</a> would force inclusion of Abbotsford-Mission into the Vancouver CMA if it wasn’t it’s own CMA already. Similar constraints prevent Toronto CMA expanding and swallowing or eating into neighbouring CMAs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92f0138m/92f0138m2019002-eng.htm">Technical restrictions of CMAs</a> to “expand” into already established CMAs raise the question if we need an additional definition of “functional CMAs” that only look at current commute patterns and contemplate what CMA boundaries would look like if we took a clean approach that ignores precedents of historically established CMAs. We might come back to this in a future post.</p>
<p>As usual, the code for this post is <a href="https://github.com/mountainMath/doodles/blob/master/content/posts/2022-08-18-25-years-of-structural-change.Rmarkdown">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, just because we can, we want to take a quick look at the geographic distribution of households by structural type of dwelling in Metro Vancouver using a dot density map. This is kinda cool, because apartment areas can be pulled out from lower-density detached house and related zoning. But we can also glimpse some townhouse neighbourhoods and even a mobile home park or two! Enjoy!</p>

</p>
<p>We’re increasingly gathering lots of different measures of residential mobility in Canada. Which is great! Especially insofar as we want up-to-date information about demographic response through the pandemic. Here we want to add the CMHC Rental Market Survey (RMS) to the mix, comparing to Census and CHS (Housing Survey) results. Adding it in reveals a general decline in tenant mobility only recently (and partially) reversed. But it also raises a mystery worth solving about divergent CHS results and points toward the value of triangulation.</p>
<section id="the-cmhc-rental-market-survey" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-cmhc-rental-market-survey">The CMHC Rental Market Survey</h2>
<p>In CMHC’s <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/market-reports/rental-market-reports-major-centres">Rental Market Survey</a> there are several bits of information that tell us about residential mobility, namely the vacancy rate, the availability rate, and the turnover rate.</p>
<p>The vacancy rate tells us what share of units are currently not rented and are looking to get rented out. This measures how easy it is for tenants to find new accommodation. A very related metric is the availability rate (now discontinued), which on top of the vacancy rate also considers units where that are still rented out but the current tenant has given notice and it has not yet been rented out to a new tenant.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Vacancy rates, in particular, are familiar to most analysts, and <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2019/06/12/simple-metrics-for-deciding-if-you-have-enough-housing/">we’ve written about them</a> <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/02/18/vacancy-rates-and-rent-change-2021-update/">a lot</a>. They’re particularly good at tracking whether we have <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/empty-house-next-door-full.pdf#page=14">enough rental apartment stock</a>.</p>
<p>Spoiler: we do not. And more broadly the primary and secondary rental market are to a large extend fungible as <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/02/18/vacancy-rates-and-rent-change-2021-update/">we have noted before when comparing vacancy rates across these markets</a>, even if the primary market generally provides better renter protection and services. Which means that secondary market rentals are also helpful in filling this gap, all housing helps.</p>
</section>
<section id="turnover-rates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="turnover-rates">Turnover rates</h2>
<p>The turnover rate measures <a href="https://assets.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/sites/cmhc/professional/housing-markets-data-and-research/market-reports/rental-market-report/rental-market-report-2021-en.pdf?rev=a5a0eaac-6f70-4058-8aa3-e6d307685910#page=155">how many new tenants</a> have moved into a unit during the past year. It is expressed as the total number of new tenants moved in during the past year divided by the total number of units. This measures residential mobility in the primary rental market.</p>
<p>CMHC started measuring this in 2016 and has reported it for every Rental Market Survey (RMS) since then. Unfortunately we aren’t aware of a single clean data source for turnover rates, so we turn to Excel files for the 2019 through 2021 Market Rental Reports and scrape it from the tables in the PDF reports for the years 2016 through 2018. This only yields high-level data for metro areas. It would be good if CMHC could put this data out in more easily accessible form, preferably as part of the Housing Market Information Portal.</p>
<p>Taking a comprehensive look at the CMA level data, ordered by mean turnover rate over our six years, we see a wide spread in turnover rate across CMAs and across years.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, tight rental markets like Toronto and Vancouver come out with very low turnover rates, indicating the lack of housing choices. This is in line with data from the Canadian Housing Survey <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2021/03/29/forced-out-in-canada-new-data-from-chs/">showing a low propensity of choice moves for overall (primary and secondary market) renters in these regions</a>. This is likely amplified by long term renters benefiting from rent control, which enables choice stability but also discourages choice mobility by accumulating a <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2018/11/28/moving-penalty/">moving penalty</a> due to market rents increasing significantly faster than in-place rent-controlled rents. Provinces with more stringent rent control - at least on the books - include BC, MB, ON, QC, and PEI (<a href="https://loanscanada.ca/rent/rent-control-laws-rules-and-regulations-across-canada/">handy abbreviated guide here</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, 2020 was a special year in this regard, with moratoria on evictions and rent freezes widespread through the early months of the pandemic. We might expect many tenants to have largely hunkered down in place. On the other hand, we might expect other tenants to have moved, following disruptions to workplace and lifestyle. Indeed, we have <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/11/29/first-peek-at-population-and-household-data-during-covid-caveats/">preliminary evidence</a> that young adults moved back in with their parents during the early months of the pandemic. More recently, pandemic protections for tenants have expired at the same time that rental markets appear to have <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/02/18/vacancy-rates-and-rent-change-2021-update/">tightened again</a>.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at turnover rates allows us to peek at how they’ve evolved over time, both up to and through the pandemic. Eyeballing the graph it looks like turnover rates were higher in the early years and lower later, with 2021 possibly breaking from this trend. To understand this in more detail we zoom in on several CMAs and plot the trend over time, treating 2021 separately.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Overall, trends for Calgary, Vancouver and Montreal seem largely unaffected by the pandemic, but Toronto, Halifax and Edmonton show significant recent increases in mobility. Is this evidence of recent differences in residential sorting processes across metro areas?</p>
<p>There are several plausible factors that can impact turnover rates, ranging from physical like unit mix and location, to demographics like age and share of students, non-permanent residents and recent immigrants which tend to have higher mobility rates. Moreover, mobility rates may be impacted by the mixture of primary and secondary rental market housing stock, with people with higher mobility rates sorting into the less stable secondary market and people looking for more stability more willing to pay the premium of renting in the primary sector.</p>
<p>That said, none of these factors seem obviously consistent with the data shown above. More work might be needed to sort out what’s going on. We should probably start by checking on how turnover data stacks up to our other measures of residential mobility for tenants.</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-check-with-other-data-sources" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-check-with-other-data-sources">Cross check with other data sources</h2>
<p>To better understand the primary rental apartment mobility rates we can compare them to two other data sources that (roughly) intersect our time frame, the 2016 census and the 2018 Canadian Housing Survey (CHS). We start with the census, which <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/27/residential-mobility-in-canada/">we just recently used</a> to understand overall mobility rates, and how they depend on CMA, age and tenure.</p>
<p>Importantly, our mobility rates are constructed differently as we switch data sources. In our numerator, we shift from all new tenants moving through primary rental apartment stock within the past year to examining currently resident tenant households of similar structures (see below) who’ve moved in the last year. So the Census and the CHS capture a similar, but slightly different group of tenant households, but record no more than a single move per household. In our denominator, we shift from dividing by total primary rental apartment stock (i.e.&nbsp;including vacant apartments) to dividing by total currently resident tenant households of similar structures (i.e.&nbsp;excluding vacant apartments). In short, these are slightly different measures. But if carried out correctly, they ought to line up pretty well with one another.</p>
<section id="census-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="census-data">Census data</h3>
<p>To find similar structures to those recorded as primary rental apartments in the CMHC survey, we will focus on households in non-subsidized apartment rentals that aren’t part of a condominium development. In absence of suitable cross tabulations we default to using PUMF data. Wanting to filter by dwelling type forces us to use the hierarchical PUMF, and even there we don’t have the ability to distinguish people in “duplex” apartments from non-stratified apartments that are closer to what the Rms might capture.</p>
<p>Before we do this we want to get an overview how mobility rates depend on different types of housing.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>These are pretty interesting results in their own right. They show a clear hierarchy of tenures in relation to residential mobility. It stands to reason that non-condo renter rates are somewhat higher than what the RMS finds in the purpose-built rental stock because it also includes secondary suite rentals. We can compare the data from the Census, which was held in May 2016, to the RMS data from October 2016, understanding the problem with counting secondary suites in the census data; counting possible multiple turnovers in the RMS data; and dropping tenants recorded as resident elsewhere in the Census. The census will also count renters in newly built units, which should show 100% mobility rates, whereas the RMS turnover rate will exclude those.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This shows that for Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal the census comes out with higher mobility rates while Edmonton and Calgary show lower rates compared to the RMS (Rental Market Survey). With Calgary and Edmonton showing very high mobility in the census of upward of 30%, it is quite reasonable to assume that the difference may be driven by multiple turnovers within a year, using the naive heuristic that if about one third of the units turned over at least once, then a little under one third of the units that turned over turned over more than once, with total turnover roughly matching the RMS numbers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the higher census mobility rates in Vancouver and Toronto may well be explained by secondary suite rentals slipping into the non-condo apartment mix. In summary, the turnover rates of the two data sources are plausibly consistent.</p>
</section>
<section id="chs-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chs-data">CHS data</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at the CHS data. The definitions are a little different here than in the census data: apartments don’t include secondary suites in this case and subsidized units are tied to the type of housing and can’t be cash subsidies like in the census. We also get information on whether tenancies are “arm’s length” between tenant and landlord (e.g.&nbsp;not one family member renting to another).</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Again, we notice a strong dependence on the type of unit, but it’s less clear-cut across CMA. Three other things stand out. First it’s remarkable that in Toronto mobility in subsidized units is extraordinarily low. Second, Vancouver stands out with a high share of people moving into non-arms length rentals, which we define here as rentals not rented by “a government” or “a private company or individual”, but instead by “a relative, an employer or other”. Third, and most notable in context, overall mobility rates look quite a bit lower than what we would expect from looking at the census.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>This is a bit baffling, the differences are quite large, the CHS shows implausibly low mobility rates. We can plot all three data sources on the same graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Again, the CHS mobility rates are implausibly low. Even though Census to CHS drops match the trend line from RMS over time, they look too low relative to those trend lines. What’s going on? It’s a mystery!</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="cross-checks-with-5-year-mobility-and-overall-mobility-rates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-checks-with-5-year-mobility-and-overall-mobility-rates">Cross-checks with 5-year mobility and overall mobility rates</h2>
<p>Let’s check in on 5-year mobility rates and cross-check with the Census. These should be less sensitive to short-term variation, and also plausibly to undersampling recent movers. Here we can even add in the just-released 2021 CHS comparison (though we can’t yet match it up to Census 2021).</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>There’s differences here, but none are especially notable, and they could be explained by sampling and/or historical variation. Census 5-year mobility rates match relatively well both with StatCan tabulated results from the CHS for both 2018 and 2021, and with the Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) results. In other words, we don’t appear to be missing or undersampling movers across the 5-year survey frame.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the Census to CHS comparison for 1-year mobility rates. Below we can really see just how stark the differences are between Census results and CHS.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Clearly there’s an issue emerging only for recent movers, those moving within the past year in the CHS data. Are they being undersampled? This seems possible… but there’s another intriguing potential explanation.</p>
<p>Data collection for the CHS was carried out between November 2018 and March 2019. This is different from the Census, which was carried out from May through July of 2016. Is it possible that spreading data collection across two years mattered? Let’s compare questions asked.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2016/ref/questionnaires/questions-eng.cfm">2016 Census long-form questionnaire</a> asks about where people lived on a specific date one year or five years prior to when data collection begins (May 10th, 2015), e.g.</p>
<p>Question identifier 22: Where did this person live 1 year ago, that is, on May 10, 2015?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Instr.pl?Function=assembleInstr&amp;a=1&amp;&amp;lang=en&amp;Item_Id=1197668#qb119973">2018 CHS questionnaire</a> asks about most recent move.</p>
<p>Question identifier: PAC_Q05</p>
<p>When did you move to your current dwelling?</p>
<p>Would you say:</p>
<pre><code>01: Less than 1 year ago
02: 1 year to less than 2 years ago
03: 2 years to less than 3 years ago
04: 3 years to less than 4 years ago
05: 4 years to less than 5 years ago
06: 5 years to less than 10 years ago
07: 10 or more years ago
08: Always lived here</code></pre>
<p>There are at least two ways these different questions could result in different estimates of the timing of a recent move for the same person. Given that Census data collection runs from May through July, they may be picking up between 12-14 months of moving risk in their estimates of one-year mover rates. By contrast, the CHS question specifies exactly one year as its cut-off for estimating one-year mover rates. But the CHS data collection also crosses a threshold from one year to the next. This makes it entirely possible that people benchmark their move not from the time of survey, but what year they moved. So those moving in, say, June of 2018, but surveyed in February of 2019, might declare their move as occurring “1 year to less than 2 years ago” - because it occurred last year - rather than “Less than 1 year ago,” which is what we’d want them to choose to get our one-year mover rates. In short, the different questions and procedures of the Census might be systematically overestimating one-year mover rates while the CHS underestimates them.</p>
<p>If some respondents benchmarked their responses to calendar year in the CHS instead of estimating backward in months from survey date, it could systematically push the reported timing of their last moves backward. Do we see this kind of movement in the CHS data? Since the CHS breaks down the timing of most recent move in yearly intervals, we can take a look!</p>
<p>By way of a primer, we might expect our one-year mobility rates to remain constant for each year prior to the survey, assuming people had the same risk of moving for each year in their past. Or, more accurately given the selectivity of movers (movers tend to move more often), we might expect that mobility rates tend to be highest for the most time period, which catch the most frequent movers, then decline for moves further in the past, where frequent movers are less represented. But if enough people are benchmarking to calendar year for past moves instead of indexing by month, then our estimated mobility rates will systematically shift those people backward, growing higher if we go back further, until the effect of frequent movers takes over.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Sure enough, our one-year mobility rates climb the further back we go, mostly peaking somewhere in the middle. In many regions it looks like the 1-2 year mobility picks up the slack left by the 0-1 year mobility shares, providing some possible supporting evidence that there may be issues with how people benchmark their responses to the CHS timing of last move survey question. Definitely worth looking into further.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this is to convert the data to 1-year equivalent mobility rates based on aggregate movers up to <code>\(n\)</code> years back. This attempts to account for frequent movers and is a cleaner way to view mobility rates.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Again we see similar patterns, and the “Less than 2 years ago” bracket looks in line with the other brackets, again suggesting that the 0-1 and 1-2 year mobility rates are impacted by how people understand the question. This is of course overplayed with possible changes in overall mobility, where e.g.&nbsp;Halifax looks fairly stable of this timeframe and some other regions showing drops in (estimated) mobility rates. We also observe a drop in the much larger range (up to 10 years ago) bracket, which likely reflects the effect of frequent movers.</p>
<p>One takeaway from this is that maybe Canadian Housing Survey results should be “adjusted” for comparability. 1-year mobility rates using 1-year equivalent mobility rates (as per above) based on the cumulative movers in the past two years might be an acceptable proxy for actual 1-year mobility rates. We can try that out by plugging those into our previous graph comparing mobility rates over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-07-29-tumbling-turnover/index_files/figure-html/residential-mobility-trend-comparison-1.png" width="1200"></p>
<p>Better! There are still noticeable differences between the sources, especially for Edmonton and Calgary which see much lower “adjusted” mobility rates in the CHS than in the RMS, but this moves us in the right direction for enabling comparisons across data sources.</p>
</section>
<section id="takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Are different questions and procedures (along with trends over time) enough to account for the different estimates of one-year mobility rates between Census and CHS? Maybe. We don’t know. But returning to the CMHC’s Rental Market Survey Data we can see that its results more closely line up with the Census. And that’s part of why we’re so glad to have another source of data on mobility!</p>
<p>Our last takeaway returns us to the trends at hand. Including turnover data, we can clearly see a pattern operating across data sources where tenant mobility in purpose-built apartments seems to be generally on the decline, with evidence of some recent bounceback. As we’ve <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/03/29/forced-out-in-canada-new-data-from-chs/">noted in the past</a>, declines are only good insofar as they reflects declines in forced moves, but they’re mostly bad insofar as they reflect declines in choice moves. Protections against eviction generally increased through the pandemic, just as vacancy rates rose in many big cities. Both of which should lead to more choices. Unfortunately, these trends have since reversed in many places. That leaves our worrisome longer-term evidence of tumbling turnovers, which we’ve also seen linked to <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfDowellMyers/status/1409304130758209540">negative trends in the USA</a>. Worth keeping an eye on!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/06/30/a-brief-history-of-canadian-real-estate-investors/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>The newest trend in the search for reasons for rising home prices is to look toward investors. The Bank of Canada released <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/01/staff-analytical-note-2022-1/">a report</a> showing that the share of investors has risen over time. For this they took mortgage data from federally regulated financial institutions and matched them with credit history to determine if some of the buyers already owned property before they bought (during roughly the past 10 years) and kept it after they bought.</p>
<p>This is an interesting method, though we’ve got questions and concerns! The method does not capture all purchases. It excludes purchases that are all cash without a mortgage (e.g.&nbsp;downsizers) and it doesn’t capture <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/06/staff-working-paper-2022-28/">unregulated mortgages</a> (e.g.&nbsp;people that go to alternative lenders because they don’t meet down payment requirements). This method may also classify as investors people who are simply co-signing loans, like family members acting as mortgage guarantors, as this kind of support often shows up in the mortgage data. If we are mostly interested in timelines and not the overall level of these estimates then some of these concerns are secondary, unless there are shifts in the selection over time (e.g.&nbsp;rising importance of <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/more-than-40-per-cent-of-young-homeowners-in-ontario-got-financial-help-from-parents-poll-1.5791164">family assistance in home purchasing</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s pull their data using Jens’ handy <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/canbank/index.html"><strong>canbank</strong></a> package and take a look at their results.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-30-a-brief-history-of-canadian-real-estate-investors/index_files/figure-html/boc_investor_history-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>In the data we see that the share of first-time homebuyers has declined over time, holding fairly steady 2018 through 2020 but then entering an accelerated decline mid 2020. Making up for this is an increase in repeat homebuyers, and starting in late 2021, a particular increase in investor buyers who pushed past their previous high around 2018. Another interesting feature in the above data is the drop in first-time buyer share early 2018 through early 2019, which is made up for by a bump in repeat buyers while investor share dropped.</p>
<p>To understand what conclusions we can draw from this we need to consider some other data points. During the pandemic homebuying activity increased significantly and interest rates hit record lows while prices skyrocketed. In times like this the main barrier to homeownership becomes access to capital, which is fairly easy for investors or repeat buyers of those with family assistance and has plausibly pushed more first-time buyers into the unregulated mortgage market and thus shifted them outside of this dataset. This makes it very hard to draw definite conclusions from this data. Is the drop in overall first-time homebuyers as strong as this dataset suggests, or is it a product of selection bias in the dataset? Or a little bit of both?</p>
<p>To understand how interest rates shift the market toward investors and repeat buyers, consider the prevailing interest rates during this time span.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-30-a-brief-history-of-canadian-real-estate-investors/index_files/figure-html/mortage_rate_history-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>We note how the mortgage rate high point for the 3 and 5 year mortgages correspond to a drop in both first time buyers as well as investor buyers, with first time buyers recovering again after a slight drop from the plateau while investors only pick up after mortgage rates hit new lows.</p>
<p>An interesting question is how these timelines will evolve now with rising mortgage rates. We expect the share of investor buyers in this dataset declining again, for the same reasons discussed above that pushed them up during the record low interest rates. We will have to wait and see how this will pan out in the date over the next year or so.</p>
<p>Either way, the Bank of Canada results are interesting, if not entirely straightforward to interpret. But the datasets drawn upon by the Bank of Canada analysis only go back to 2014. For the rest of this post, we thought it would be fun to take a longer view.</p>
<p>The longest view, of course, takes us back to how <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2020/07/30/lots-for-sale/">real estate investment</a> was bound up with Canada’s <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/3-turning-points-history-vancouver-real-estate-1.4653565">ugly history of colonial expropriation and land dispossession</a>. We’re not going to go that far back simply because we don’t have the data handy. Here we’ll explore what share of Canadian families have been real estate investors since the 1970s. We’ll define real estate investors for the rest of this post similarly to the Bank of Canada as families owning property other than their primary residence, except we are looking at the stock instead of the flow. For this we consult the <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=2620">Survey of Financial security</a>, and two of it’s precursor surveys, which gives us information on this question in irregular intervals back to 1976.</p>
<p>Here we’ll just do a provincial overview.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-30-a-brief-history-of-canadian-real-estate-investors/index_files/figure-html/investor_history-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>We start with a provincial breakdown. This is useful for drawing out some varying patterns. These include relative stability in investor ownership in Ontario, a general drop in Quebec and a general rise across the Prairies and Atlantic provinces. BC has perhaps the weirdest trajectory, following a sort of S curve, with investor ownership falling into the 90s, then rising to a peak in 2016 before dropping again to near 1976 levels by 2019. Interestingly, though many local observers think of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/3-turning-points-history-vancouver-real-estate-1.4653565">Expo 86</a> as a turning point for real estate investment in BC, the share of families owning investment property actually dropped to its all-time low between 1984 and 1999. As a general caveat we should note that there is some uncertainty in these estimates based on the SFS or the precursor surveys, and we probably should not over-interpret small fluctuations.</p>
<p>Returning back to the national level, and matching this up to Bank of Canada estimates, we can see that recent results from the SFS on current ownership (a stock measure) run a little lower than the 17%-20% of purchases by investors (a flow measure) estimated for the country as a whole between 2014-2021, but they’re in the same ballpark, and multiple purchases by investors could easily account for the differences. Also, people who make mortgage guarantees for family members or other people and show up in the Bank of Canada mortgage data as investors may not think of themselves as owning (part of) that secondary property and won’t list it in the SFS survey. On the other hand, the SFS also counts properties outside of Canada owned by Canadian residents, which might tilt the bias the other way.</p>
<p>We can break this down finer to also break out what share of family units own or rent their primary residence.</p>

<p>Most Canadians do not own any investment property. The big long term story across most of Canada is either stability or a rise in owner-occupation and a decline in renter households (especially since peaks in 1984). The Atlantic provinces are the exception, with the trends running in the other direction.</p>
<p>Of those owning an investment property, a real, but relatively small proportion of households rent, with long-term trends here either rising or stable. Most investors (as we’ve broadly defined them) also occupy housing they own.</p>
<p>Putting these trends together, the rise in investor ownership seems especially strong in the Prairie and Maritime provinces, but possibly for opposite (and even interrelated) reasons. Rising oil patch wealth in the Prairies likely boosted real estate investment purchases. Meanwhile, the relative decline of opportunities in the Maritimes and their uneven impact may have contributed to more people looking for rental housing (because they couldn’t afford to buy) while others became landlords in response. Indeed, many from the Atlantic provinces may have saved up money while temporarily working in the oil patch to buy properties back home which could then be rented out (and this may account for some of the relatively high rates of ownership of properties elsewhere for renters in the Prairies).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the longest timelines from surveys are only at the provincial level. But in future posts, we may return to looking at metro areas and comparing once again with results from Bank of Canada methods, as well as CHSP.</p>

  <title>Ins and outs of CMHC data</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This is a data-focused post, it’s targeted at people consuming or otherwise working with CMHC data. And also at the future me that will stumble again over problems outlined in this post and will have to remember the ins and outs of CMHC data.</p>
<section id="the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-data">The data</h2>
<p>CMHC creates and maintains lots of important data on housing. We start with an overview over the more important data sources, and the relevant definitions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/surveys/methods/methodologies-starts-completions-market-absorption-survey"><strong>Starts and Completions Survey (Scss)</strong></a> tracks housing starts, completions, and related data. Data is available on a monthly frequency down to census tract geography and can be split by intended market. Part of this is the Market Absorption Survey that tries to track how many units remain unsold after completion, and at what prices completed units sell.</p>
<p>The definitions of the structural types differ from StatCan definitions in important ways, for example a single family home with a secondary suite will be categorized as two “duplex” units by StatCan, but as one “single” unit plus one “rental apartment” unit in the Scss.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/surveys/methods/methodology-rental-market-survey"><strong>Rental market survey (Rms)</strong></a> aims to track privately initiated market rental apartments with at least 3 units by bedroom type, age of structure and number of units in structure. It also collects information about rents and vacancy rate. The data is available on an annual frequency (twice annually before 2016) down to census tract level geography.</p>
<p>Rms data often gets misrepresented as covering “rental apartments”, but it excludes a broad range of rental housing like non-profit or other non-market or public housing, seniors housing, student housing and secondary rentals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/surveys/methods/methodology-secondary-rental-market-survey"><strong>Secondary Market Rental Survey (Srms)</strong></a> aims to capture information on the secondary rental market, in particular condominium units but also other secondary rentals. Data quality is substantially lower than the primary rental market survey (Rms), but it adds important context and serves as a cross-check to make sure the conditions found via the Rms broadly carry over to the overall rental market. Data is available at an annual frequency down to the CMA level.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/surveys/methods/methodology-seniors-housing-survey"><strong>Seniors’ Housing Survey</strong></a> targets senior’s residences.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-cmhc-r-package" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-cmhc-r-package">The <strong>cmhc</strong> R package</h2>
<p><img src="https://github.com/mountainMath/cmhc/raw/master/logo.png?raw=true" width="30%" style="float:right;padding-left:15px;"></p>
<p>All of this is important data that is relevant to many housing related questions, and we have been using this data extensively. CMHC does not have a data API, but our <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/cmhc/"><strong>cmhc</strong> R package</a> develops a pseudo API to facilitate easy programmatic access to the data and enables reproducible and adaptable analysis. Version 0.2.0 contains many breaking changes to the previous version that we have used in past work and blog posts, we have <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/cmhc2/">archived version 0.1.0 to maintain reproducibility</a>, installing this package, now called “cmhc2” and loading this instead of the <strong>cmhc</strong> package will enable older work to continue to run through unchanged. These breaking changes hopefully won’t cause too many issues, but the old version was not very user friendly, and there were (likely) only a handful of people using it anyway. But starting with version 0.2.0 it should be a lot more broadly accessible.</p>
<p>There are also various other less organized data sources strewn over a selection of excel sheets and PDFs, including <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/housing-market-data/residential-conversions-demolitions-statistics"><strong>demolitions</strong></a> with <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/chic/Listing?item_ID=%7B53A57B68-6755-4C6E-A564-8B4A53122A5B%7D">older demoltions in PDFs</a>, <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/rental-market/average-apartment-rents-vacant-occupied"><strong>rents of vacant apartments</strong></a> and others.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-gaps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-gaps">The gaps</h2>
<p>There are important data gaps and categorization issues that need to get fixed. As housing becomes more complex, our traditional ways of accounting for, measuring, and tabulating housing need to evolve. Things have changed a bit within CMHC data reporting, but not enough to keep the data robust and maximize it’s usefulness.</p>
<section id="non-market-housing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-market-housing">Non-market housing</h3>
<p>There is no good data on non-market housing. The Scss does not distinguish market or non-market rentals, although it does break out co-op housing. The Rms does not cover non-market housing at all, some non-market housing is captured in the Seniors survey but it isn’t broken out.</p>
<p>There is the fairly new <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/rental-market/social-affordable-housing-survey-rental-structures-data">Social and Affordable Housing Survey</a> that now has data for 2019 and 2021, although it only gets released as Excel sheets, only has provincial and CMA breakdowns, and is generally of low quality.</p>
<p>Non-market housing is inherently complex and difficult to enumerate. There is a broad spectrum of types of non-market units, how far below market are rents set, what the eligibility criteria for renting are, and how wait lists are administered to name a few important questions.</p>
<p>But the lack of comprehensive decent-quality data on non-market housing makes it really hard to understand how regions are doing in meeting housing needs. There are some initiatives underway to catalogue non-market housing, but it is not clear to me that this will turn into a regularly updated and reliable data source.</p>
</section>
<section id="student-housing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="student-housing">Student housing</h3>
<p>Student housing is not enumerated as part of the Rental Market Survey. In theory it should be part of the Scss if it has self-contained units, but in practice coverage is spotty. Here in BC we have seen a resurgence of student housing getting built, which helps take pressure of the overall rental market. But we don’t have good and accessible data sources on this.</p>
</section>
<section id="classification-problems" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classification-problems">Classification problems</h3>
<p>Starting sometimes in 2013 CMHC realized that secondary suites are part of the housing spectrum, and CMHC Scss data started to count secondary suites. But how is a start of a house with suite classified in Scss data? It’s a start of a “Single” homeowner unit and a start of an “Apartment” rental unit. Similarly, laneway homes are classified as “Single” single-detached rental unit. We can pinpoint the change in how to account for suites by looking at the data. The idea is to look for apartment completions with just 1 unit in them. We don’t have individual structure data, that’s internal to CMHC. But if we don’t count suites we expect that there only very rarely be a census tract with just one rental apartment unit completions, rental apartments will have more units and only the occasional small stacked townhouse would slip through, maybe having staggered completion times. But if we do count suites, then there should be census tracts with just one suite completing in a given months.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-12-ins-and-outs-of-cmhc-data/index_files/figure-html/counting-suites-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>And indeed, the number of census tracts that see just one rental apartment units completing jumped in January 2013, this should be the date when CMHC data started counting suites in the Scss. Some census tracts may well have more than one suite completing in a given month, but here we are just focused on determining the timing of when the Scss methods changed. But this does pose an obstacle if we wanted to estimate how many rental completions are suites. CMHC has the ability to break out secondary suites in the Scss data, and they have done so in their <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/market-reports/housing-market/housing-supply-report">recent Housing Supply Report</a>. It would be nice if they could also break it out in their HMIP data.</p>
<p>Also, non-market rental housing, as well as senior housing, are classified as rental apartments in the Scss, but they aren’t part of the Rms universe, just like suites and laneways aren’t.</p>
<p>Laneways can be <a href="https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/999511896603607042">accounted for fairly easily as “Single” starts or completions with intended market “rental”</a>. But the not being able to break out suites, non-market, and senior housing creates mismatches with the Rms data.</p>
<p>We take a look how this works out during the past three years in Metro Vancouver municipalities. For this we are interested in the number of new rental units, so rather than looking at net change in the total number of units in the Rms rental universe we only look at the change 2018-2021 in the units built 2000 or later, assuming that none of these will have gotten torn down. We compare that to Apartment and Row completions with intended market “rental” from the Scss that completed July 2018 through June 2021, the time frame matching the target of the Rms. This removes laneway homes from the completions, but leaves secondary suites, non-market housing and senior housing.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-12-ins-and-outs-of-cmhc-data/index_files/figure-html/completions-vs-universe-change-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>We can see that the difference between the two is rather large. Vancouver’s Rms universe has about 3k new units, but the Scss records about 6k rental Row and Apartment completions. That’s a factor 2 difference, and it’s not out of the ordinary looking at other municipalities, in some the mismatch is larger, in some it is smaller.</p>
<p>The difficult question is what does it tell us? Is the difference mostly secondary suites, or non-market or senior housing? Or is this due to misclassification in mixed-tenure buildings, which CMHC has a hard time properly capturing in their database. Mixed-tenure buildings, where part of a building is operated as strata, and another part as a purpose-built rental, or part is market rental, part is non-market rental, have become increasingly prevalent over the recent years.</p>
<p>The answer to this question matters for policy makers. Secondary suites are a great way to better utilize existing housing, but secondary suites are a double-edges sword, they don’t offer the same legal protections to renters as purpose-built rental and are inherently insecure. Of all types of housing, suites are the most frequently classified as “unoccupied” in the census, and there is no regulation that could compel owners to rent them out like we have for e.g.&nbsp;condos in form of the Empty Homes Tax or Speculation and Vacancy Tax. Colloquially they are often referred to as “mortgage helpers”, which captures the power dynamic and who these units mainly serve. For forward looking housing policy, <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2021/06/08/basement-confidential-vancouver-s-informal-housing-stock/">secondary suites are probably not the best form of housing to incentivize</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, non-market or senior housing is very much something that policy does want to incentivize. We have a desperate need for more housing of this type. If the purpose-built stock shrinks because a non-profit provider bought out a rental building and converted it to non-market housing, then the decrease of the purpose-built (market) rental stock will have a very different effect on overall housing outcomes than when a building just gets torn down. Right now it is difficult to distinguish those two scenarios from the data we have.</p>
<p>At the metro level we can use the Seniors survey to pull out net new senior housing spaces, between 2018 and 2021 Metro Vancouver gained 1,084 of these. But the gap between the rental universe and rental Apartment and Row completions was 60,686 units, leaving (roughly, this does not account for senior housing demolitions) 59,602, or 87% of rental completions unaccounted for in Metro Vancouver over those three years.</p>
<p>Or in other words, about half of Metro Vancouver’s rental completions were secondary suites or non-market housing. Probably. Or misclassifications. This kind of accounting by differencing can be error-prone. But it highlights the problem we have with understanding what kind of housing gets built.</p>
<p>Take the following graph, versions of which have been making the rounds. It’s the change in purpose-built market rental units in Metro Vancouver municipalities over the past 5 years.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-12-ins-and-outs-of-cmhc-data/index_files/figure-html/net-change-market-rental-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>It shows that some municipalities have gained market rental units, others, most notably Burnaby, have lost market rental. Many municipalities have set adding purpose-built market rentals as a policy goal. But the same is true for non-market units, and Burnaby has now <a href="https://www.burnabynow.com/real-estate-news/update-burnaby-passes-bold-rental-only-zoning-plan-to-protect-create-housing-3100350">set an explicit goal to replace market rental that is lost with non-market units</a>. This is a fairly recent change, and probably won’t have had much impact on the time frame depicted in this graph, but going forward it would be important to understand this. Just looking at the change in market rental apartments won’t suffice to understand how things are playing out in Burnaby, we need good accounting of non-market rental too.</p>
<p>We can get a glimpse of possible demolitions by splitting the data up by year of construction. This is not perfect, some older units might undergo deep renovations that require the building getting vacated, at which point they cycle out of the Rental Market Survey, and then later reappear as “old” (by year of construction) units.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-12-ins-and-outs-of-cmhc-data/index_files/figure-html/net-change-market-rental-year-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Both New Westminster and Langley show that they have gained “old” rental over this time frame, hinting at units taken off for deep renovations getting occupied again and cycling back into the survey. Another way to gain old rental is hotel conversions. But without better data it is hard to say what is going on there. How many older rental buildings were demolished? How many were converted to non-market housing? How many are undergoing deep renovations? This data can’t tell us, we would need to painstakingly look through other data sources to answer this question.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="data-quality" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-quality">Data quality</h2>
<p>Continuing along the lines of the previous section we can get a closer look is by comparing rental row and apartment completions to changes in the Rms universe at the census tract level.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-06-12-ins-and-outs-of-cmhc-data/index_files/figure-html/data-quality-geo-mismatch-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Plotting the difference between the two turns into an unexpected mess. The light blue regions are somewhat expected, these tend to be single family areas that have plausibly seen additions of suites over these years. The reddish areas are curious, these indicate that the Rms gained more Rms units built “2000 or later” between 2018 and 2021 than there were rental apartment and row completions in the Scss. This should not be possible.</p>
<p>The two census tracts at UBC stand out, with both showing large gaps of opposite sign. Looking more closely into the data it appears that some rental units have initially been incorrectly geocoded to the wrong census tract, which was subsequently corrected. But the change has not been applied consistently through time, making it appear in the data that a lot of market rental was demolished in one census tract and replaced with market rental in the other census tract.</p>
<p>We see similar issues in the West End, Yale Town, and Joyce-Collingwood.</p>
<p>This bring us back to the caveat from earlier, how differencing data can bring out problems in faulty datasets. And the difficulties of using CMHC data for analysis, it generally requires ground truthing and extensive cross-checking. Ideally we would have better quality data, but CMHC data simply isn’t designed to be a robust data source for (rental) housing. This could be fixed of course, but it will require a concerted effort that goes beyond just switching to a more modern database architecture.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-way-forward" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-way-forward">The way forward</h2>
<p>CMHC is a great source of housing data. Housing data is important. But CMHC data also problems. It is broadly used to inform housing discussions, but probably lacks the necessary robustness for some of the nuances. In broad strokes we know what the problems driving our housing issues are: We have a housing shortage and need more housing. But we need data to guide our response and monitor our progress and benchmark against. Tracking and understanding our housing stock is one important ingredient in this, and Canada would be well-served by better housing data.</p>
<p>Some of these gaps are getting addressed, but progress is slow. Administrative data remains locked up by many provinces. Nova Scotia is an outlier here with open data for property characteristics, assessment data and sales data, showing the way forward for other provinces to follow. British Columbia still chooses to keep this data locked up and sell it to private interests (as well as other branches of the Canadian government), fostering an information imbalance between large developers who buy this data and have the analytics capacity to use it on one side, and municipalities and the general public who only get selected subsets of the data at best and don’t have the capacity to create comprehensive analyses using their insular datasets. Ontario is probably in the worst shape, having lost control over how their administrative property data is used after outsourcing and selling it off. Although New Brunswick doesn’t even have a provincial land title registry.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca%2Fimdb%2Fp2SV.pl%3FFunction%3DgetSurvey%26SDDS%3D5257&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kazgXo7LjC5RSYfiLa0ch">Canadian Housing Statistics Program</a> has been trying to fill some of these gaps by buying and processing this data and linking it to demographic data, the other side that’s needed to address housing questions. StatCan’s refreshed <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3410006601">building permit series</a> helps understand how our building stock is changing, but the geographic resolution is unnecessarily coarse. The <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=5269">Canadian Housing Survey</a> fills another important gap by trying to understand why people move and how satisfied they are with their living arrangements, and how this differs across segments of our society.</p>
<p>Some of CMHC’s methods are woefully antiquated. Starts and completions information is great, many other places don’t have this. The way this works in Canada is that people drive out to addresses where building permits have been issued to monitor construction and collect information on starts and completions. This could be automated by training a model on satellite images. StatCan is rumoured to be working on such a project, but it’s been taking quite a bit longer than one would expect.</p>

  <title>Residential mobility in Canada</title>
  <dc:creator>Jens von Bergmann</dc:creator>
  <link>https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/upshot/housing-market-slow-moving.html">excellent NYTimes article on mobility in the US coming out today</a> nudged me into doing a quick post on residential mobility in Canada. While there are lots of similarities between Canada and the US, there are some important differences when it comes to residential mobility. A while back <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2019/11/24/why-do-people-move-new-data-mysteries-and-fundamental-rights/">Nathan Lauster compared residential mobility between the two countries</a> and noticed that the declining trend in US residential mobility is much more muted in Canada, and may have reversed by the 2016 census, the last year for which we currently have data in Canada. (The 2021 data is slated to come out on October 26, 2022.) Nathan’s post also takes a closer look at what has changed in the US and why residential mobility declined by examining the reasons people give for moving. And Yes, it’s housing related reasons that are driving the decline in moving.</p>
<p>The NYTimes article places this into a longer timeline, showing that this trend started well before the 2000-2001 year which Nathan used as a starting point. While we are waiting for the 2021 data we want to take this as an opportunity to push the Canadian data back a bit further to see how Canada’s residential mobility has evolved. And also look into how this varies across the country and depending on tenure and age.</p>
<section id="one-year-mobility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-year-mobility">One-year mobility</h2>
<p>The NYTimes article looks at 1-year mobility, which is a useful metric because few people move more than once within a year and thus gives a good measure of residential mobility. Unfortunately, this is not available prior to the 1991 census.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>Overall this paints a picture of declining residential mobility across Canada, with hints of a recovery during the year before 2016. But the level of residential mobility, as well as the shape and makeup of the decline, varies across the different CMAs broken out here. For the initial 1990-1991 movers data we don’t have a breakdown for people moving within the same municipality (“Non-migrants”) and people moving from elsewhere within the province (“Intraprovinical migrants”). Additionally, we need to be aware that some metro area have expanded over this time period, as have municipal boundaries – most notably the City of Toronto between 1996 and 2001. That complicates interpreting these timelines.</p>
<p>As Nathan already observed on his blog, most moves are local, and the reduction of mobility is mostly driven by local moves. To better zoom into this we can plot the data as a line graph, which does reveal some divergence from this pattern for some regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>In this post we want to dive a little bit deeper into residential mobility, looking at longer timelines, and understand how this relates to age and tenure.</p>
</section>
<section id="five-year-mobility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="five-year-mobility">Five-year mobility</h2>
<p>If we want to go further back in time we have to content ourselves with looking at 5-year mobility data, so the share of the population who lived at a different address 5 years prior. This is available in electronic form back to 1971.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>Here we have some finer categories, splitting up intraprovincial migrants into those staying in the same census district and those coming from a different census district in the same province.</p>
<p>But how does this look like across different parts of the country? We only have information for Montréal and Toronto all the way back to 1971, more metro areas get added to the PUMF in successive censuses.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>In addition to the caveats we already mentioned above, that some metro areas as well as some municipal boundaries have changed over time, the relationship of metro areas and the cities within to census district also varies, with for Vancouver the census district and metro area coinciding, but for Toronto the City boundaries coinciding with their census district starting with 2001. That can lead to some artificial changes among the categories.</p>
<p>Each of these regions shows an overall declining trend in residential mobility. We will look at how this interacts with tenure and age to better understand what is driving this.</p>
</section>
<section id="tenure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tenure">Tenure</h2>
<p>We know that renters move more frequently than owners. This happens for many reasons, which are worth getting into in more detail, but we will leave this for another post.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>Comparing the mobility rates we indeed see large differences by tenure that dominate the differences across metro areas. Renters move much more frequently, but the decline in mobility is visible in both categories.</p>
</section>
<section id="age" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="age">Age</h2>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>Again we see a fairly consistent decline in mobility across age groups. Especially the 20-24 year old age group stands out, and the older age groups also show a clear drop in residential mobility.</p>
<p>Dropping the mobility status take a look how this differs across metro areas.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>The trends are fairly consisted, although e.g.&nbsp;Montréal is showing lower drops than other metro areas, hinting that some of this effect may be due to <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/06/estimating-suppressed-household-formation/">suppressed household formation that we have observed in a previous post</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="putting-it-all-together" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Looking at the difference across age and tenure we can ask ourselves how much of the overall drop in residential mobility are explained by these two. This lets us remove the effect of change in tenure and age distribution across time and across geographies, using the 2016 overall Canadian distribution as a counterfactual demographic distribution.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/adjusted_age_tenure-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>This shows that some, but not all of the effect of the declining mobility is explained by shifts in demographics and housing tenure. But some differences remain, in particular it’s remarkable how low Montréal’s residential mobility is, especially when accounting for tenure. Which also hints that tenure itself is probably less of a driving factor of mobility, but that there are other factors apart from age that are a common cause of tenure and mobility. And the model adjusting for age and tenure should probably be treated with caution.</p>
<p>One last remaining question is that of the role of external migration. That does not quite fit into the concept of mobility for the purposes of this post since external migrants don’t corresponds to moves of people in Canada but rather moves into Canada. We can remove external migrants and see how that changes things.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-27-residential-mobility-in-canada/index_files/figure-html/adjusted_age_tenure_external-1.png" width="816"></p>
<p>This does somewhat depress the mobility rates of regions that see a lot of external migration, but the general pattern is quite similar.</p>
</section>
<section id="upshot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upshot">Upshot</h2>
<p>Moving is an important factor in our economy and our housing system. In our housing discussions, for example during the ongoing public hearing of the Broadway Plan, many people have a very naive understanding of how residential mobility works. There is often an implicit assumption that new buildings have to be matched with newcomers. We know this is by and large not how things work, <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2019/12/08/who-lives-in-new-housing/">the majority of people who move into new housing already lived in the region</a>. Similarly, the vast majority of people who move move into old housing. One very obvious way to see this is that <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/11/children-are-good-actually/">almost half of the population in the City of Vancouver lived at a different address five years prior</a>. Which highlights the absurdity of people questioning who new housing is for. New housing only makes up a tiny portion of destinations for movers, it’s perfectly ok if it only suites a small portion of those people moving. That’s not to say we should not strive to create non-market housing whenever possible, we absolutely should. (Raise my property taxes to pay for it!) But denying new housing because e.g.&nbsp;median incomes can’t afford it misunderstands how housing and mobility work and is counter-productive.</p>
<p>Trends in mobility are interesting because they have implication for the broader economy. If people can’t easily move, they may not be able to change jobs to one that better fits the skills and pays more, and on the flip side employers will have a harder time recruiting talent to increase their productivity. People may get stuck in housing situations for longer than they want, resulting in <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/06/estimating-suppressed-household-formation/">suppressed household formation</a>. Adjusting for changes in demographics can help better understand these trends, and alleviate underlying causes of reduced mobility.</p>
<p>Another important direction is to understand the reasons for moving. In Canada we are only now getting decent data on why people move, with the <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2021/03/29/forced-out-in-canada-new-data-from-chs/">CHS giving us a way to understand reasons for moving, in particular forced vs choice moves</a>. This view allows us to shine a light onto the two sides of residential mobility, which can be bad if people are looking for stability and can’t find it because they are forced to move, or it can be good if it enables choice moves closer to work, family and friends, or amenities, or to adapt to changing family needs. We are looking forward to the next round of the CHS data getting released.</p>
<p>A good discussion on declining residential mobility in the US and its implications and drivers can be found <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02673037.2021.1929860?journalCode=chos20">in a nice recent sudy by Dowell Myers at al</a>, broken down in <a href="https://twitter.com/profdowellmyers/status/1409304130758209540">easily digestible form in a twitter thread</a>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>With a <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/skytrain-nanaimo-station-transit-oriented-development-proposal">new redevelopment proposal around Vancouver’s Nanaimo Skytrain station hitting the news</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GoldinYVR/status/1527075936381784064">a local journalist feigning ignorance about zoning around skytrain stations</a>, maybe it’s time for a quick post on zoning and population growth around the Nanaimo Station.</p>
<p>To start out, let’s take a look at the zoning around Nanaimo Station.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/nanaimo_zoning-1.png" width="432"></p>
<p>We marked the Nanaimo Station at the centre and the 29th Avenue station to the south-east just outside of the 800m radius circle. The area is dominated by single family and duplex zoning, with a couple of half-blocks of low rise and some mixed-use low rise zoning along Kingsway and sprinkled across a couple of of other lots, as well as some Comprehensive Development parcels to round things off. The Skytrain corridor is visible as a the diagonal low-density (RS-zoned) line.</p>
<p>The Skytrain has been operational for almost 40 years now, let’s take a look how zoning has changed over time, utilizing the data from the <a href="https://zoning.sociology.ubc.ca">Metro Vancouver Zoning Project</a> where we have also assembled a <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/cov_zoning_history">timeline of zoning in the City of Vancouver, taking snapshots at several years</a>. For this we will start with 1976, well before the Skytrain arrived, and continue with 1990, 5 years after the station opened, and several snapshots in the following years until now.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>We see that not much has changed over the years. The industrial parcel right by the station got lost between 1976 and 1990 and some CD-1 parcels came in. Then things were mostly stable until a little RM-7 and RM-9 low-rise zoning, plus some more CD-1, appeared between 2001 and 2020. But almost all of the low-density yellow area remained untouched, despite the rapid transit line.</p>
<section id="population" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="population">Population</h2>
<p>Time to take a look at the impact on population and dwellings in the area. For this we turn to the census, but census regions don’t perfectly line up with our 800m station catchment, and census regions change over time. To get stable and robust estimates over time we will first harmonize our census regions to construct a common geography based on 2001 though 2021 Dissemination Blocks, which we have automated with our <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/tongfen/articles/tongfen_ca.html">TongFen package</a>, and then select the ones with majority overlap with our station buffer.</p>
<p>Here is what this looks like, including the harmonized dissemination blocks with partial overlap.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="576"></p>
<p>We coloured the regions by their overlap percentage. To keep things simple we select the ones with majority (50% or more) overlap. Which gets us to the following “census catchment” region that we will use to track change in population and dwellings over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="576"></p>
<p>Armed with that we can now check in on how the population and dwellings have changed in this census catchment area of the Nanaimo Station. For context we also add the corresponding changes for the city overall and the metro region.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Here we observe familiar patterns.Metro Vancouver has been <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/05/25/projections-and-self-fulfilling-prophecies/">growing faster than the city</a>, making the city more exclusive relative to the region, as <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/08/01/on-vancouver-population-projections/">dictated by regional planning</a>. The 2001-2006 dwelling growth captures the change in census methods capturing the re-classification of suited detached homes into two “duplex” units, which is especially prominent in the Nanaimo Station region that is dominated by single family homes, and which contrasts the population growth. Regular readers of this blog will recognize this change in census methods as the issue still <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/01/27/mythical-oversupply/">getting exploited by anti-housers</a> who misrepresent this as dwelling growth exceeding population growth and evidence of the absence of a shortage of housing.</p>
<p>Generally we see that the population around the Nanaimo Station has been growing comparatively slowly, except for the 2016 to 2021 period. To better understand what has been going on there we will take a look at population and dwelling growth at the block level.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Here we see the initial boost in dwellings in single family areas, as well as several separate blocks with dwelling boosts, one between 2006 and 2011 on the north side of Kingsway west of Nanaimo where a low-rise mixed use building got built, and another one across the street where a large new development (with the T&amp;T) came between 2016 and 2021.</p>
<p>The new development proposal asks to turn 18 single family lots into 861 new homes for a net increase in roughly 835 additional homes to the area (depending on how many have suites), a 16% increase in the total number of homes in the area. Which would single-handedly be the larges increase in dwellings between any of the four inter-census periods of the past 20 years, enabling lots more people to make use of this transit investment.</p>
</section>
<section id="longer-timelines" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="longer-timelines">Longer timelines</h2>
<p>The 2001 to 2021 timeline above is too short to cover the entire time since the Nanaimo station opened. Before 2001 StatCan did not release data at the dissemination block level, which is why we stopped there. Even dissemination areas did not exist before 2001, the finest geography was the discontinued <em>enumeration areas</em>, which don’t lend themselves well to TongFen with later data. But for Vancouver we do have a <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/06/15/census-custom-timelines/">custom cross tabulation that codes data from all the censuses all the way back to 1971 to 2016 dissemination area geographies</a>. This allows us to push this back to 1971, at the expense of basing this on dissemination area geographies (and using TongFen to push it forward to 2021). Let’s take a look at how good our geographic match with the Nanaimo Station catchment area is when using the coarser dissemination area geography.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>We see how the areas we are matching now are larger, using the same criterion as before and only including areas with at least 50% overlap we arrive at the following geography that we have consistent data on.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>It’s not as good a match as before, but now we have population data all the way back to 1971 and can track the population growth across this timeline.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Here we converted to annual rate of change because we have periods of different lengths, the first period spans 10 years instead of 5. The Nanaimo Station area did not follow the overall drop in population that Vancouver experienced in the 70s, but since 1981 it grew slower than the city average, with the exception of the 1996-2001 period. We note that even in the final 2016 to 2021 period the growth was slower than that for the overall city, which is different from the result we got higher up where we used dissemination block based estimates, with the main difference being that our dissemination area based estimates exclude the new development on the south side of Kingsway (with the T&amp;T).</p>
<p>The only growth period 1996-2001 is interesting, it is connected to the opening of the station 11 to 16 years prior, but given Vancouver’s pattern of extremely slow and unresponsive housing delivery this is certainly plausible. A closer look at the geographic breakdown of the inter-census population change might shed a light on this.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Looking in particular at the 1996 to 2001 period there does indeed seem to be some growth near the station, but the largest population growth is further away from the station to the north and north-west.</p>
<p>The net effect over the entire time period remains disappointing, with the City of Vancouver population growth running significantly higher than the growth in the Nanaimo Station area.</p>
</section>
<section id="upshot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upshot">Upshot</h2>
<p>Vancouver planners have been neglecting past transit investments, with the new Broadway Line coming in the province is not leaving things to chance and have directly intervened to ensure that Vancouver does not waste this massive infrastructure investment by keeping exclusionary zoning in place that keeps people away from billion dollar transit investments.</p>
<p>Here is a more comprehensive look at Vancouver’s existing transit stations, ordered roughly by how wasteful the landuse is in the 800m around them. Nanaimo Station is unsurprisingly the worst offender, but there are quite a few others that are not far behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-21-nanaimo-station/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="912"></p>
<p>I would not be surprised at all if we are going to see provincial intervention to force higher land use around these stations. There is a <a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/rupert-and-renfrew-station-area-plan.aspx">planing process underway for the Rupert and Renfrew Station Area</a>, which is still deep in the engagement process. The Vancouver Plan might in theory be a vehicle for the city to act decisively first and remove the necessity for provincial intervention, but realistically speaking we are sill several years off before the Vancouver Plan and the subsequent area plans are passed and zoning is changed. The <a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/broadway-plan.aspx">Broadway Plan will serve as a test</a> to see if Vancouver is able to achieve higher land use around stations on their own. The plan has been in the works for four years now, the coming weeks will tell if council is serious about this, but even then, <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2022/05/17/on-broadway/">the Broadway Plan may well fall short of achieving its goals</a>.</p>
<p>Allowing more people to live near the Nanaimo Station, if council allows this proposal to go forward, will be a good start. But we really have to wonder why council after council have not touched the sea of yellow low-density areas around such a key infrastructure investment. And even this current proposal only touches a mere 18 single family lots.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>(Joint with Nathan Lauster and cross-posted at <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2022/05/17/on-broadway/" target="_blank">HomeFreeSociology</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>We have finally found some time to take a closer look at the <a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/broadway-plan.aspx">Broadway Plan</a>. There are many good things to say about the plan, it adds housing in an amenity and job rich area about to get a new subway line. It promises to not just undo the downzoning the city imposed on parts of the area in the 1970s but enables a bit more housing to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>The plan also tacks heavily against the displacement risk to renters in the established rental apartment areas by both 1) limiting the redevelopment potential in those areas and 2) increasing the strength of tenant relocation and right of return policies, a hard-learned lesson from the redevelopment activity around Metrotown in neighbouring Burnaby. In short, overall there’s a lot to like.</p>
<p>In this post we want to accomplish several somewhat diverse goals</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provide some code to improve the data analysis in the plan that uses census data,</li>
<li>Place the Broadway plan more firmly into context of historical zoning changes in that corridor, and</li>
<li>Interrogate the decision to limit development potential in the existing low-density areas, which we have argued in the past <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/02/21/planned-displacement/">make for ideal sites to concentrate development becaues of their low displacement implications</a>.</li>
</ol>
<section id="the-broadway-corridor" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-broadway-corridor">The Broadway Corridor</h2>
<p>The Broadway Plan document chooses to use census tracts as the basis for census data for the Broadway Plan, and to track changes in the corridor since 2001. This is a fairly coarse geography choice since census tracts are rather large and extend quite a bit beyond the outlined area. Dissemination area data is available for all censuses since 2001 and is much better suited to approximate the corridor. If only data on population, households or dwellings is required, then dissemination block data can give even better estimates.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-17-on-broadway/index_files/figure-html/combind_census_data-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>We will get different census estimates for the Broadway Corridor depending on which of these we choose. The Census Tract based geography is quite coarse and will likely skew the estimates, the other two are probably better choices. To understand the difference let’s take a quick look at population estimates.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-17-on-broadway/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>As we would expect, the number of people in the Broadway Corridor depends on the level of geography we chose to approximate the region, and the differences are noticeable. Close observers will note that in addition to the Broadway Plan area, the CT level includes additional parts of Kitsilano and Olympic Village, while the DA level mostly adds Olympic Village, largely accounting for differences in estimates and the larger jump in DA level post-Olympics. If we want to understand the population in a particular year instead of comparing it on a stable region across years we can do better and approximate the region by using the census geography for just that year instead of resorting to using a harmonized geography.</p>
<p>However, these differences matter less when looking at rates, or at change over time as the following graph on the growth during the inter-census periods between 2001 and 2021 demonstrates.</p>
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-17-on-broadway/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>These estimates are quite close and indicate that the damage from using a coarse Census Tract based approximation is probably not too large. But the inclusion of Olympic Village, in particular, likely boosts growth estimates in recent years.</p>

<p>Using maps we’ve assembled from archival research for the <a href="https://zoning.sociology.ubc.ca/">Metro Vancouver Zoning Project</a>, we can put together an historical comparison of how zoning along the Broadway Corridor has changed. This won’t catch all the change, and as we’ll discuss in a minute, that’s an important caveat! Nor have we fully back-coded our historical data to match with our most recent data, refining and harmonizing what our zoning codes are actually allowing. But we can still get a glimpse of some of the changes that have occurred just by looking at the maps.</p>
<p>From the start, the Broadway Plan area mixed industrial uses to the North, with Apartment and Commercial districts in the middle (especially along Broadway), and Low-Density Single Family and Duplex Zoning to the South. The overall story emphasizes a history of experimentation with this mix, encouraged by de-industrialization but also constrained by reactionary moves to downzone and pull back, preserving single-family, duplex, and low-rise areas from change.</p>

<section id="industrial-expansion-and-contraction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="industrial-expansion-and-contraction">Industrial Expansion and Contraction</h3>
<p>The biggest visible change probably concerns Industrial zoning. There was an initial expansion, from the <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/consolidated/3575.PDF">modernization of the zoning by-law in 1956</a> to 1963, when <a href="https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/zoning/zoning-by-law-district-schedule-i-1.pdf">Industrial zoning</a> swept into the formerly residential zone to the NE of Cambie and Broadway. Only Jonathan Rogers Park remained zoned residential, though a few old houses were grandparented in and have now stuck around long enough to be <a href="https://council.vancouver.ca/20220518/documents/pspc1appendixA.PDF#page=61">considered heritage</a>.</p>
<p>After this initial expansion, we can see a gradual contraction of Industrial zones along False Creek. The contraction occurred in line with broader North American trends toward urban de-industrialization. Vancouver was notable mostly for its success in shifting so much former industrial land over to a mixture of residential and commercial use. South False Creek was probably the biggest example of this as a coordinated process along the Broadway Corridor, with the area given its own zone between 1974 and 1976, and supported across multiple levels of government as an experiment in residential mixing (with decidedly <a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/false-creek-south-fact-sheet.pdf#page=3">mixed results</a>). But this area isn’t actually included in Broadway land use planning, so we’ll set it aside. One of the last big industrial areas to turn over to residential in the Broadway land use planning area was an old brewery on the western edge, tucked between 10th and 12th, which became <a href="https://www.arbutuswalkliving.com/">Arbutus Walk</a> in the 1990s.</p>

<section id="expanding-apartment-options" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expanding-apartment-options">Expanding Apartment Options</h3>
<p>Mid-Century planners looked to enable an update and expansion to Vancouver’s increasingly built-out apartment districts after the modernization of the Zoning Code in 1956. This was roughly in line with planner Harland Bartholomew’s expectations that the initial zoning plan would only last for <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/02/04/bartholomews-dot-destiny/">about thirty years</a>. Mid-century planners gradually edged the low-rise apartment RM-3 districts outward through the 1960s and early 1970s. This was coupled with an effort to enable towers as a new built form throughout old RM-3 zones via a change to maximum heights in 1961. Correspondingly, towers began to pop up in Kitsilano, Fairview, and Mount Pleasant.</p>
</section>
<section id="reactionary-downzoning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reactionary-downzoning">Reactionary Downzoning</h3>
<p>The 1970s brought in a new party strongly opposed to the proliferation of these new towers: TEAM. They took over council in 1973, installed a new planner, and began downzoning, especially across Kitsilano and Mount Pleasant, shifting high-rise RM-3 lands down to low-rise RM-4 districts. Only the RM-3 surrounding Granville remained. As a result, many of the old towers built from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s could no longer be re-built today, ranging from the apartment buildings near 2nd &amp; Vine in Kitsilano to the Senior’s Housing built for the Lutheran Church across from City Hall at Yukon &amp; 10th (the latter also featured as Stop Four in our <a href="https://homefreesociology.com/2021/03/05/virtual-vancouver-zoning-tour/">Virtual Zoning Tour</a>). In effect, the reactionary downzoning of the 1970s actively forbid the kinds of heights only now being re-enabled by the Broadway Plan today.</p>
<p>We see the old TEAM’s housing legacy, on the whole, as decidedly mixed; balancing downzoning of denser forms with support for low-rise variety and adding housing to former industrial lands (see <a href="https://viewpointvancouver.ca/2022/01/20/revising-history-with-sam-sullivan-the-team-era/">Gordon Price &amp; Sam Sullivan</a> for a less charitable view). But regardless of the old TEAM’s legacy, if you think we’ve got more than enough housing now, then the newly resurrected <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/colleen-hardwick-team-mayoral-candidate">TEAM for a Livable Vancouver Party</a> might be for you. If you don’t think we’ve got enough housing today, well… we’d probably have a lot more older and more affordable housing now if we hadn’t downzoned so much of the Broadway Corridor fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Looking forward, we can and should start building the housing we think people will want some thirty years into the future. That’s what the Broadway Plan aims to start enabling. As a reminder, we also want there to be a “some thirty years into the future” for people to live in, which the Broadway Skytrain expansion will help insure to the extent it gets people where they need to go without greenhouse gas emission. And we need people to live near the Skytrain for that to work.</p>

<section id="proposed-zoning-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-zoning-changes">Proposed zoning changes</h2>
<p>While the plan at this stage does not provide the legal text for zoning changes, it does lay out in some detail how it envisions zoning to change in various areas. These changes are the last point we’ll address.</p>
<section id="conditional-rules" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conditional-rules">Conditional rules</h3>
<p>It’s not clear from the plan how much the actual zoning rules will rely on conditional vs outright zoning. And if the plan envisions to rezone the area, or if it’s just left as a guiding document and every single development will require a council decision to move forward like in the Cambie corridor.</p>
<p>For Multiplexes and Townhouses (11.2), as well as Low-rise Apartments (11.3), the proposed rules in <a href="https://council.vancouver.ca/20220518/documents/pspc1appendixA.PDF#page=276">section 11</a> of the Broadway Plan do seem to be sufficiently clear in the density that’s allowed, a clear improvement over general practice in Vancouver to regulate multi-family housing via conditional zoning (or rezoning) only. However, when it comes to Mid to High-Rise Apartments (11.4), Mixed-use High-rise (11.6), Mixed-use Residential (11.7), Office (11.8), Industrial/Employment (11.9), or Transit Integration (11.10) areas no clear guidance on height and FSR is given. Others, like the Mixed-use Low-rise (11.5), while clearly intended for housing purposes refers to existing zoning documents that only allow housing conditionally. This continued over-reliance on conditional zoning and planner discretion in the process will server to further feed into Vancouver’s climate of speculation and developer concentration that planners have fostered for many decades now.</p>
</section>
<section id="inclusionary-zoning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inclusionary-zoning">Inclusionary zoning</h3>
<p>The plan has fairly aggressive inclusionary zoning requirements, which we are guessing have been tested by the housing economics group to ensure that projects are marginally viable. However, there seem to be no contingencies built into the plan to allow for market prices and rents to fall. If that were to happen (an outcome many would welcome), the projects allowed in the plan will most likely become unviable and development will pause until prices climb back up. We believe this is a major shortcoming of the plan. Even if falling market prices and rents aren’t a direct goal of the plan, maybe because of its limited geographic scope, it should be explicitly allowed by the plan. The plan should probably be amended to allow for the possibility of falling prices and rents. It’s worth noting that another way to insure we continue to build through any downturns, of course, might be to <a href="https://www.policynote.ca/financing-public-housing/">get government involved in building</a>, but this, too, remains beyond the Plan.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="low-density-areas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="low-density-areas">Low density areas</h2>
<p>A final part of the plan worth interrogating is how it deals with the low-density areas within the corridor. These are the remaining areas in yellow in our historical map. We support the move to protect and slow down development in the existing rental apartment areas, but a more balanced approach would offset these protections by <a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/02/21/planned-displacement/">allowing more density in the areas with minimal displacement risk</a>. Even more disappointing is how these zones that allow higher and lower density apartments are delineated. They don’t follow planning patterns like proximity to subway stations, or jobs and amenities. Instead they’re simply based on continuing forward existing exclusionary and fairly arbitrary historic zoning patterns. In that sense they are largely backward-looking rather than forward-looking, baking in exclusionary decisions made by planners long-dead.</p>
<p>Just to illustrate this problem, consider Fairview South - Area C. <img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-17-on-broadway/images/FSOC.png" class="img-fluid" alt="FSOC"></p>
<p>Planners think the FSOB area just to the north is good for up to 6.5 FSR, with 20 storey towers conditionally allowed on some sites, but the highlighted FSOC areas only allow for a maximum of 6 storeys 2.7 FSR rental buildings. As an example, let’s take a look at the existing built form around the leftmost of the two FSOC areas looking north toward the FSOB.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2022-05-17-on-broadway/images/FSOC_left2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>FSOC map view</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We notice that just across from the FSOC area on the north side of 14th Ave there are existing 13 storey buildings. These combine a rental building constructed in 1972 (thanks 1960s upzoning!) with an additional infill rental building <a href="https://cd1-bylaws.vancouver.ca/CD-1(661).pdf">enabled in 2017 via spot-zoning</a>. But now, 50 years and a subway line later, planners think only six storey rental buildings make sense across the street. It’s really hard to interpret this as anything but deference to decisions made by planners many decades ago of where to draw the fairly arbitrary lines delineating higher density from lower density zones, an act that seems more akin to religion than to planning.</p>

<section id="upshot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upshot">Upshot</h2>
<p>While this post devotes quite a bit of space to what we feel are some of the weak points in the Broadway Plan, overall it is a vast improvement over the status quo. While it can’t undo all the damage done by the downzoning of much of the corridor in the 1970s, it does revert back to allowing buildings that could be built before the downzoning and adds more options. Allowing more people to live in a jobs and amenity rich area close to a new subway line is good.</p>
<p>Protecting existing renters is good too, and we are happy to see that planners are avoiding some of the mistakes that were made in Metrotown.</p>
<p>The plan also takes a cautious step toward more predictable outright zoning, at least for the lower density parts of the plan, which is welcome.</p>
<p>We are hoping that our concerns around the ability to dynamically adapt inclusionary requirements to changing market conditions can be incorporated at the bylaw stage of the plan, planners should include contingencies that allow for falling market prices or rents.</p>
<p>Our concerns about low-density areas, and how the delineation between planning areas are chosen, are painful reminders of how planning can become too focused on historical (right or wrong) paradigms and stay disconnected from the physical and economic realities. Hopefully the Vancouver Plan can do a better job at re-imagining our city from a forward-pointing rather than backward-looking perspective, and undo some of the arbitrary zoning divisions in the current Broadway Plan.</p>
<p>To sum up, one thing the Broadway Plan does well is tack against exclusions of existing renters by “the invisible hand of the market.” One improvement would be to also tack against “the invisible hand of planners past,” keeping our eyes more firmly fixed on securing a more inclusive future.</p>
